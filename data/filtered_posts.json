Pick a provider based on proximity to your average customer, tour the facility and ask lots of questions about their processes. Good luck!",

        "content": "Hi r/Logistics\n\nI consult for an organization that is looking for a US customs broker that can handle T86 entries for ecommerce for goods that cross the northern border by truck. Entry volume per day is around 5,000, increasing at peak. They ship six days a week, year round. Only a portion of these daily entries are on the table for this opportunity, but it is a permanent opportunity, and the percentage of entries to be filed as T86 will probably increase as regulatory ramps up in the US.\n\nThey're an experienced ecommerce 3PL with a stable client and commodity base. The client themselves holds all required FDA, Health Canada and other licenses or registrations. *This is not a marketplace like TEMU etc.* The clients have a mix of non-regulated and regulated products. Food, Dietary Supplements, general consumer household goods etc. COO is mixed but mostly COO US, Canada or China. These are currently cleared with a mix of S321, T86, informal and formal entries depending on the situation. They're looking for aggressive pricing from a broker well experienced in ecommerce that can handle mass submissions of entries (Excel template upload or API/EDI).\n\nThey're very savvy on compliance and IT fronts. The commodities don't change frequently - these are well known brands and products with long product lifecycles - again, this is *not* a marketplace. These are de minimis imports of the same product day in, day out, each to a new consignee.\n\nDesired launch date is ASAP - they could start sending entries as soon as next week if the right partner is found.\n\nThey are looking to speak only with brokers who are well experienced with ecommerce T86. The daily trucking could be on the table in the future as well depending on the partner. This is potentially a multi-million dollar per year account for a brokerage / forwarder with the right service and product lineup. DM me for more detail and if you think you have a solution.",

                "body": "I used to do that, before ChAtGPT I had a set process to CM(Y)A. My boss hated my email system (inbox zero) with folders for everything based on the segment (Shipper, Carrier, origin agent, destination agent, trucker, etc) I did this with 125 shipments a week, FCL, LCL and Air. Having it all organized made things so much easier. Combining that with Quick steps and reminders saved me sooo many headaches. \n\nUltimately you need to teach your people (origin, shipper, destination agent, trucker, etc) how you want/expect things. Once you get that done it runs smooth, things happen but as long as you plan and prepare you should be fine. If you don't do anything, that's when the stress happens. \n\nAutomate as much as you can and look at the process constantly to see how you can simplify it. \n\nI use Chat GPT and other AI programs hourly to make adjustments. \n\nCarriers will respond to you if you threaten to take the work if they aren't doing it to the level you need. Short pay for incorrect ppwk and be on the lookout for new carriers.",

                "body": "Two main points from much experience here:\n1. Stress is often the bi-product of poor time management. Not always but often. If you designate 30 min time periods throughout the day for different task, you will find that you can dip into the most major parts of your AOR each day. You have to stick with it. If something urgent comes up and requires your immediate attention (always, I  know) then do it and return to your task window of time. \n\n2. Those of us that are diligent tend to take things personally when they don\u2019t go as planned. If there are things not under your direct control, let that shit go. I took all failures of other people and it ate me up. I\u2019m speaking mainly of internal operations like sales or finance. If it\u2019s a vendor making your life miserable, replace them. If it employees that report to you, replace them. But let what you can\u2019t fully control go.",

You know what will take 10 minutes and what will take 2 hours, not the person on the other end of the phone/email.\n\n\nPersonally, I start the day and bang out the quick tasks first. Then move onto the more detailed requests, and towards the end of the day start on the newest requests. \n\n\nI do get pulled away from this plan throughout the day to handle truly urgent and time sensitive items and that's ok. Handle that and then get back to the plan you made at the start of the day. \n\n\nAs other commentors have said, this is all about time management in the end and having an understanding of your abilities and your company and customers needs overall will help you navigate each day. There is always tomorrow and there is always more.",

        "content": "I've been at my current job for seven years and been in the logistics role since 2020. All of my training was done in a month and all additional \"training\" has been done by myself finding free seminars and such. The company I work for has been doing worse and worse due to declining sales and issues getting materials. Plus, they refuse to pay for an ongoing training.\n\nSo, I'd like to start looking and training for a new job. Would prefer remote but willing to move to a blue state for a job (currently live in a deep red one). I'm making $51,000 in my current role.\n\nMy duties include:\n\n* Importing containers of finished goods from Central America (filling out ISFs for broker, coordinating with warehouse and 3PL for delivery)\n* Exporting containers of materials to Central America (making bookings, creating MBOLs and Commercial Invoices, filing the EEIs on the Automated Export System (AES), providing all paperwork to the 3PLs we use)\n* Coordinating with freight companies to get our air shipments picked up quickly and delivered on time to customers\n* Ensure we are following all rules/regulations for C-TPAT compliance\n\nI've saved my company thousands of dollars by changing what companies we use and how we move our goods/materials. I've made actual SOPs instead of the handful of handwritten scribbles I was given by the person who trained me. Convinced our company to get our shippers HAZMAT certified because the one person in our company who was HAZMAT certified had quit.\n\nSo, I've got some experience but I'm not sure what roles I should look for or work on training for. I doubt I'd be good at sales (have never been in a sales position). Since I've only been at one company with little training (outside of what free seminars I've found online), I don't really know what my chances are against people with degrees or multiple roles. I'm not looking to make bank, just be comfortable.",

Here are some potential roles and recommended training:\n\nSuggested Roles\n\n\t1.\tLogistics Analyst or Supply Chain Analyst\nYour experience with import/export, cost-saving, and SOP creation is directly relevant. Analysts often support data-driven improvements, helping companies optimize their supply chain and cut costs.\n\t2.\tImport/Export Compliance Specialist\nMany companies seek specialists familiar with ISFs, AES filings, C-TPAT, and hazardous materials. This role leverages your compliance knowledge and could allow you to expand into trade compliance.\n\t3.\tOperations Coordinator/Operations Specialist\nOften similar to logistics but with broader focus on day-to-day operations, process improvements, and cross-departmental coordination.\n\t4.\tLogistics Manager or Supply Chain Coordinator\nIf you\u2019re interested in management, these roles would allow you to use your SOP creation and coordination experience to lead a team or manage a segment of a larger supply chain.\n\nRecommended Training\n\n\t1.\tC-TPAT Certification & Export Compliance Training\nCourses in compliance will reinforce your understanding of regulations and could make you a more competitive candidate for roles emphasizing safety and compliance.\n\t2.\tFreight Forwarding and Customs Brokerage Training\nGaining more advanced knowledge in freight forwarding and customs brokerage (even if you won\u2019t be performing these roles) can broaden your logistics skill set.\n\t3.\tData Analytics in Logistics\nConsider a course in data analytics (e.g., Excel, Power BI, or Python for data analysis) to give you a competitive edge for analyst roles, helping you better track and report on logistics KPIs.\n\t4.\tProject Management Certification (PMP or CAPM)\nProject management can strengthen your ability to coordinate complex logistics operations. Even a basic certification can be beneficial.\n\nGeneral Tips\n\n\t\u2022\tHighlight Your Savings and Efficiency Contributions on your resume, as they are valuable to companies looking to improve margins and streamline processes.\n\t\u2022\tNetwork in Logistics Communities online or through free webinars.

We don't know what our volume will be. And I am going to assume we'd have 3-5 people working (mostly family and friends to start lol).\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions or input?",

Starting out, I'd recommend using ShipStation or similar solutions over Excel as your basic foundation.\n\nIn our early days, we used SkuLabs until we outgrew it. We then switched to SHero, which we've been using for the past 6 years. While SHero is comprehensive, it isn't cheap, so I'd hesitate to recommend it to someone just starting a 3PL.\n\nCurrently, we're exploring alternatives to SHero for various reasons (happy to discuss privately). Some options we've looked into include:\n\n* Warehance: A really solid and more affordable solution started by my friend who also used to use SHero\n* Packiyo: Created by an ex-SHero founder, seems fairly solid but lacked some features we needed\n* Logiwa: Another established option in the space\n\nWe've been moving over to Warehance and it's been working out really well for us. In this industry, you'll likely end up using one of the major players like SHero, Logiwa, or similar solutions as you grow.",

I really like Hopstack for the FBA part simply because the depth I have seen them go into with their Amazon flows. Dealing with Amazon is really tricky as everyone knows, and I have gone through switching many softwares before settling on Hopstack. Most importantly the customer service is awesome which is what you want from your WMS provider:\n\nHowever, I see that a lot of new merchants are also getting into starting prep businesses or starter 3PL businesses like yourself. Hopstacks main platform is prolly an overkill. So they have another product that was launched a while ago called Ignite that focusses on starter businesses. I\u2019ll highly recommend that. The alternatives that I have tried like scanpower, prepshiphub haven\u2019t been that great for my clients.\n\nYou can also stitch something together with excel and airtable, but the effort involved might not be worth your time. So I suggest keeping 200-300$ as a monthly budget for the software.",

My day to day is essentially as a dispatcher for our drivers and am basically a one man show for our freight brokerage operations. Truthfully, I am burnt out of operations and the complete and utter chaos that comes with both being asset based and running a brokerage. Im not really supported at my current company in that they wont hire anyone to help as we expand and frankly ownership runs things like it is the 1980s. It is like pulling teeth to modernize. Admittedly, freight is not our bread and butter as we are a distributor who delivers our own product more than we are a trucking company and the trucking and brokerage side exist just to support our distribution operations, so i am a bit of an afterthought and am expected to just move everything on a whim when we need more trucks for our outbound. Its an interesting idea to employ enough drivers and still have flexibility when outbound is slow. Im not upset at it, its what I was brought here to do but truthfully I am just burnt out from putting out fires with customers and managing drivers. I think I could have success in TMS software sales or support, where I can still use my knowledge of transportation and not be involved in the day to day of shipments, but thats just a thought. \n\nAnyone successfully transition out of operations and into a logistics adjacent role? If so, what are you doing now and are you doing well financially? ",

        "content": "\n\nHi everyone, I am new to ecommerce and am working on launching my ecommerce brand in a few months. \n\nWe have narrowed down all of our suppliers (they are all in Asia - either China or Korea). However, what I am struggling with is how to think about shipment fees here and make sure that I am not being charged too much or being charged too little (aka scammed somehow). \n\nI have asked for shipment fees DDP from these suppliers - however since we have multiple cartons coming from various places, I think if we somehow ask all of them to send to one Freight Forwarder, in one city, and that FF can combine all the shipments together, the rate would be more beneficial for us correct, instead of shipping these cartons separately? \n\nFurthermore, we will send these to a 3PL, and 3PL also has charges for receiving per pallet or per carton as well, so we think consolidating cartons before FF can send them out makes sense. \n\nI have reached out to a bunch of FF on Alibaba, and FF in China, and FF in Australia (since we are sending all cartons to Australia), and the rates for extremely different. \n\nLet\u2019s take an example of a total shipment of 200kg (after all cartons are consolidated), I am getting quotes from $1-$2/kg DDP sea 30 days, to $1000, to even $2000 to ship the whole thing. So that is a range from $1-$10/ kg. \n\n- Which price is correct? I feel like $10/kg is way too high since even when I am asking each supplier to ship separately to Australia, the freight ocean is way cheaper\n- Also the $1000 and $2000 quotes are coming from FFs based in Australia btw. I was advised to find FFs where I am based, and not where I am importing from. So should I work with Chinese FFs or Australian FFs?\n- If I work with FFs from Alibaba, how can I trust that they are legit. If they have high reviews and ratings on the website, and if I put the transaction under trade assurance, would I be safe?\n\n\n",

If your shipment consists of general goods, most freight forwarders in China can offer similar rates. In this case, whether your forwarder has a warehouse in China to consolidate your shipments becomes a key factor (as you've correctly understood, shipping larger volumes in one go generally leads to lower rates).  \n  \n2. Many people may suggest using a local forwarder, but the biggest drawback is often the lack of competition, leading to higher prices. In fact, local forwarders often collaborate with Chinese forwarders, simply earning a markup on top of the original rates.  \n  \n3. This is where Alibaba Trade Assurance comes in. By using this service, your payment is only released to the forwarder once you've received and confirmed the shipment. If any issues arise during transit that prevent you from receiving your goods, you can open a case and claim your shipping fees back.",

I have worked for 2 more 3PLs and had a ~30x loads per day book. However, there is only so much you can learn/expand your career on with carrier sales. I wanted to learn the other side of the business, but without taking a step back to broker sales and starting a transferable book. I decided to start looking for direct shippers/vendors/freight forwarders to further grow my career.\n\nI have recently landed a job as a logistics analyst at a very big company that manages the supply chain for a fast food chain. I am now a couple of days into the position, and I cant help but feel overwhelmed. The interview process was very transparent, as far as me being honest with my resume and not sugar coating a ton of analytical experience, and I knew there would be a learning curve.\n\nThe biggest difference right off the bat is not having that daily hustle of trying to get the most books you can that day. Putting in the dials and books everyday is how I proved my work. I am inquiring about the previous analyst (left on his own accord) about what he did well and didnt do well from networking early on with everyone. Outside of that, I am not really sure my best avenue to be the best I can be in this position.\n\nAny advice/tips/experiences from being in a fast paced sales role to moving to an analyst role would be greatly appreciated.",

I don\u2019t know your metrics or how your company evaluates your performance, but it\u2019s a game changer once you find those parallels. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve established that baseline, work to get extremely efficient in those while applying your previous experience in your analytics role.

For reference the loss rate was 0.1% at prior 3PL's (1 in 1000 units) and we deal with bulky (small appliance) items. I feel like 1% loss rate is way too high\n\n",

        "content": "I work for a home appliances company that hires contracted 3PL (third-party logistics) providers to make daily truck deliveries to various dealers. All delivery orders are pre-arranged and planned in advance. For example, if the sales department confirms with a client that 50 units of TVs will be delivered tomorrow, the 3PL will deliver them within the working hours window the next day.\n\nOne practice of our 3PL provider is that their truck drivers never call the receiver before delivery. They simply show up at the location and request to unload.\n\nOver time, I\u2019ve come to understand the reasoning behind why our 3PL doesn\u2019t call before delivery:\n- Since the delivery is pre-arranged, if you request delivery for tomorrow, you should be ready to receive it at any time during the day.\n- Drivers have multiple drop points in one trip. If they call each receiver before delivery, the receiver might request a specific time, which isn\u2019t ideal for the driver who has already planned the route.\n- Phone calls are an expense, and reducing them can save costs for the 3PL.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m unsure if this is standard practice for all similar 3PL providers, where there\u2019s no calling before delivery. It\u2019s quite frustrating because the sales department frequently calls me for ETAs, and I can only tell them, \u201cIf the receiver requested delivery today, they should be ready to receive it at any time during working hours.\u201d The sales team argues that this practice is irresponsible and negatively impacts customer experience.",

Pursuing a Master\u2019s in Supply Chain Management \u2013 I\u2019ve been planning to pursue a master's in Supply Chain Management. I believe it could help me advance my knowledge and career in the industry.\n\n2. Starting my own transport company \u2013 On the other hand, I\u2019ve always wanted to start my own transport company. I\u2019ve already started obtaining required licenses and have been researching the industry quite a bit. My plan is to start small and expand gradually.\n\nI\u2019m passionate about both options, but I can\u2019t decide which one will offer the best long-term growth and satisfaction. What are your thoughts on pursuing a master's vs. jumping into entrepreneurship in the transport sector? Shall I do the master's first and then go for business, or vice versa?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",

During the cross-docking process, one of the parts of a high-value machine was damaged.\n\nIt is important to note that I had explicitly told the carrier\u2019s dispatcher when booking the load that any change in the truck or trailer must be communicated in advance. Additionally, it was clearly specified in the rate confirmation that any unapproved changes would result in non-payment.\n\nGiven the customer\u2019s claim process will be initiated soon, I am seeking advice on whether I should deduct the carrier\u2019s cost due to the non-compliance and damages. (Not all payment)\n\nWould deducting the carrier\u2019s payment be appropriate, or is there a better approach to resolve this?\n\nThank you for your guidance.",

I'm looking to distribute a hand cream in 150ml tubs to get started. Packages under 1kg are really cheap to send. I'll be incorporating the delivery cost into my sale price (will provide free shipping), so the cost of delivery matters a lot to me. Storage was also very cheap. They charge for the first pick where others seem to offer the first for free.\n\nThey have a center in Germany close to the France border. I'm also outside of the EU and Germany seems to be the best option, for logistics and also setting up for VAT. \n\nI do have a small reservation with Fulfillment Box as their email communication for the sales has been difficult... I'm hoping its not a sign of things to come. They tell me that once a contract is signed they set up a Telegram chat with the team assigned to the project. \n\nIf you get in contact with them I'd be really interested to hear your thoughts! As I'm in the process of signing on with them but not locked in yet.\n\nThe other two I was considering were Octopia and Huboo. Huboo has a 375 Euro minimum spend per month, Octopia had more expensive storage but a free first pick",

        "content": "I\u2019ve been working in logistics for the past decade. I started working as a bike messenger at a courier company in 2014, and subsequently worked a variety of office roles including dispatch, operations management, business development, and account management. This company gave me exposure to Ops/Sales for both asset-based and 3PL networks, with a wide range of service offerings (expedited parcel, LTL, white glove, air cargo, medical specimen shipments, etc). We were a smaller company, about 30 office workers and 100 drivers, and I felt like a \u201cbig fish in a little pond\u201d. \n\nAs I started to hit a ceiling at the \u201cmom and pop\u201d courier company, I enrolled in an associate degree and advanced certification in Supply Chain Management & Logistics in 2020. After graduating in 2022, I started working at a midsized Freight Brokerage as an Account Manager. We are a split model brokerage, so my role is primarily customer facing (not cradle to grave brokerage). Our company was acquired by a larger company shortly after I started, and the merger has been disillusioning - constant policy/goal changes, high employee attrition, clashing cultures, etc. I am recognized for my high performance, but am much more a \u201csmaller fish in a bigger pond\u201d now. I am successful as a freight brokerage account manager, but am feeling completely burned out with the challenges of establishing myself as a newer freight broker in a down market. I\u2019ve been working 50+ hours a week, and feel that I\u2019m so busy putting out the same set of fires, that I rarely have the opportunity for meaningful career growth. I\u2019m regularly working 50+ hours a week, and don\u2019t feel like the stress aligns with my compensation (roughly $70k) or growth goals. New job openings at my company are far and few between, and I don\u2019t see a pathway for growth beyond just growing my BoB as an AM. \n\nI am interested in branching out, potentially away from the logistics side of the industry. I am great at spreadsheets and data (I have an advanced certification in Excel) and am very computer savvy. I am very interested in automation/AI, and feel like I\u2019d be a great fit leveraging these skills in a role like analyst, purchaser, etc. I have demonstrated success in sales, but don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s who I truly am as a person. Similarly, I\u2019ve been a successful people manager before, but going back into management isn\u2019t very appealing to me. \n\nI live in Chicago (Southside, far from downtown where most offices are - but close to many truck/rail yards and factories, etc), enjoy working from home, but would not be opposed to an in-person or hybrid role if needed. I\u2019m hoping to maintain my current salary level of at least $70k. My community college certification was heavily based on the ASCM syllabus. I\u2019ve thought about getting a CLDT or CSCP, but am not sure if that would tip the scale with where I\u2019m at / trying to go right now. \n\nCurious to hear your thoughts on potential roles, industries, companies, etc that might align with my current set of skills, experience, and education.

Most 3PLs don't have an ABC license. But it will depend on the product and how it's classified. Wine and spirits are easier than straight-up alcoholic beverages.",

I\u2019d love to hear from those of you who are already in the trenches:\n\n\t\u2022\tHow do you maintain profitability while managing overhead costs like rent and packaging?\n\t\u2022\tWhat strategies have worked best for scaling up without sacrificing quality or increasing stress levels?\n\t\u2022\tAre there any unexpected challenges or tips you wish you knew before starting?\n \nAlso, have you worked as a shipper with companies like warehut.io?\n\nI\u2019m particularly interested in hearing about the balance between managing a small operation and staying profitable, especially if you\u2019re doing this part-time. Any insights would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance for your advice!\n",

Mostly you have to find ways to safely and effectivily optimize the space you have, and what works this year might not next. Likely you'll have an agreed rate system, and you're competing with established companies whom found ways to already by competitive. Your cost directly relates to the small Ecomm's cost per shipment, and they can't be competitive if you're not affordable and reliable. Clients will come and go, and if you're going after small clients this will be often.  \n  \n2. Things go wrong. Often. Employees call off, carriers don't show up, power outages, leak in roof, internet outages, equipment breaks, safety incidents, theft, damages and those are just issues on your side. Clients will also have their own problems they will expect you to fix, it's a relationship and it's not passive.  \n  \n3. Being a 3PL isn't always about being directly profitable. Many companies leverage their 3PL business as a VAS on a small margin to effectively win more lucrative freight contracts. 3PLs also aren't about being the cheapest, in most cases it's a balance of quality, reliability, and cost like any business. It also takes a lot of people, infrastructure and intervention to keep things going.  \n  \nIf you want passive, you are better off doing the EComm side on something non-propiertary resale instead of the distribution side.",

        "content": "I\u2019ve been operating a small online sales business since 2018. While it\u2019s profitable, it takes up a huge amount of my time that I could be dedicating to other income streams. \n\nI\u2019ve started researching 3pls as an option, but I don\u2019t really don\u2019t think my net profit is high enough to justify it. I\u2019m curious about the actual number as well as the profit margin. At what net profit might using a 3pls make sense?",

                "body": "It depends on the amount of space needed for the storage and operation along with the order velocity.  Even a smaller 3PL will be a huge commitment on your part because they'll want you to pay for a minimum amount of space plus the handling rates.  You'll also have to work out the integration on how orders are transmitted to the 3PL.  This is both for incoming POs to receive inventory along with the outbound customer orders.\n\nYou may want to first investigate something like a marketplace solution.  For example, both Amazon and Walmart offer services where they'll warehouse your product and process orders transmitted from your website.  Fulfillment by Amazon and Walmart Fulfillment Services will store your inventory in their facilities and process orders from your website.\n\nUltimately, you have to be comfortable with the decision.  Even those solutions (FBA & WFS) may not be a step you wish to take just yet.",

If you have any intentions of growing your brand with the  time you have freed up from not shipping orders every single day, then you should look into partnering with a 3PL even as a reference point.\n\nAs others have said, communication between client and 3PL are key as it surrounds PO\u2019s and receiving. However, once the partnership is established it is near impossible to beat the efficiency of a well suited 3PL that can handle 10x your daily volume without disruption.",

Picked up at the same warehouse and delivered to the same customer. Got it picked up last Wednesday with a transport company I've used many times. It was delivered on Thursday and I got the POD on Monday morning.\n\nThen my customer emails at noon saying they did not get all of their goods. After some back and forth, the trucking company told me that the warehouse only loaded the 7 skids for AWB B on the drivers truck (they say the driver gave the warehouse both AWBs). The company is telling me it is the warehouse's fault for not loading the correct pallets. The warehouse is just giving me a big shrug about it.\n\nI live on the other side of the country so I can't check myself for them being properly loaded. Whose responsibility would this fall under? Trucking company? Warehouse? No one?\n\n  \nETA: I might be using the wrong term. The trucking company is a logistics company that contracts through smaller trucking companies. Is that a brokerage? Logistics? 3PL?",

                "body": "I was once in your position of finding a 3PL company for our US company. Let me share you the steps I made. \n\n1. Decide on which location you want your warehouse to be in. Remember, you will be having a physical nexus in that state so be familiar with the sales tax in that state. You also need to register in that state. \n\n2. Search and search. Google, reddit, youtube. I also fill up some forms in 3PL finders like Fulfill.com. They are very responsive and gave good leads. This is also one of the reason why I joined this subreddit even if I am not a logistics person. Well, you need to wear many hats in a start-up. \n\nAnother trick I made is to find the nearest Port (say, in Texas) in Google maps. Search for 3PL and it will show you the 3PLs in the area. \u201cWalk\u201d around the area near the port going further and reach out to the companies you see in the map. \n\n3. Track all the companies you reached out to. Sometimes they don\u2019t respond immediately. This way, you can do follow ups on them. It is difficult to find a 3PL that can cater to large and heavy items. Most of them prefer high volume (in terms of orders), low value goods. \n\nOr, you just want to know where are you in the quotation stage. \n\n4. Give a deadline for this process. Tell the prospects when is your goal to start the partnership. Give specific date. Sometimes they cannot accommodate you and that\u2019s alright. Note it in your tracker. You might need them in the future. \n\n5. Get your numbers ready. You will be answering a lot of questions from prospective 3PL companies. You may encounter logistics jargons. Ask google or chatgpt or the 3PL company if you have questions. \n\nUsual questions are number of orders in a month, storage requirements, qty of inbound supplies, last mile delivery requirements, etc. They are a lot. \n\n6. Once you receive all quotes, do sample computation in order to compare apples to apples. Now you are done in quantitative part. Next, qualitative. \n\n7. Search for reviews in the internet. Ask reddit. \n\nGo back to your impressions during the meeting or while conversing with them via email. Are they responsive or dismissive? Do they offer something that could lead to another service that you might need in the future? \n\nAsk qualitative questions. What is their order accuracy guarantee, communication preferences, return guidelines, etc. \n\n8. Combine both quantitative and qualitative items you get from them then decide on which one to get. \n\nThese are a lot but I don\u2019t think I was able to put them all here. If you have more questions, reply here or message me. \n\nI used the steps above in finding our two 3PL partners in the US and recently, in Canada. Next goal is the EU or maybe UAE\u2014depends on the management\u2019s directive. \n\nI am part of an e-com brand too and this is my experience when I expanded my role to the logistics.\n\nAnother note, if you are a small to medium company, it is best to stick with small to medium 3PLs. Famous and large 3PL companies don\u2019t really prioritize small ecom businesses. Our experience with them is not good.",

I can tell you from an ecomm fulfillment perspective, the last mile fulfillment economics really only make sense for the massive carriers who coordinate large volumes of parcel shipments going to the same zip codes, so that's a hard area to disrupt without the economies of scale. Having said that, there is always demand for faster door-to-door delivery time and I would be interested to hear how you plan on executing and scaling this idea.",

I\u2019m considering looking into work from home jobs but everything related to logistics seems to be cold calling jobs and 3PLs. With my experience I feel I can do a lot more but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s out there. I was researching customs brokerage and the exam requirements to become licensed/certified and that seems interesting to me. Any suggestions? ",

It's cool that you can earn a decent amount, but it must be stressful dealing with the potential for losses and the pressure to keep customers happy.\n\nI work at a smaller 3PL, and our commission is a lot more straightforward. We get a percentage of the gross profit on each shipment, usually around 10-15%, with no draw. We don't have to worry about losses coming out of our pockets, but the earning potential is definitely lower than what you're describing.\n\nI'm curious, how do you manage the stress of potential losses? Do you have any strategies for minimizing risk?\n\nI've also been wondering if it's worth switching to a company with a higher commission structure. What would you say are the pros and cons of your pay plan compared to something like mine?\n\nI appreciate you sharing your experience!

Someone with the same issue? I called UPS to see if there was a price rise or something, but nothing changed from their side, according to them. We're using the same package, same weight, same dimensions, etc, but from last week onwards pricing increased by 60% (!!).\n\nIs someone having the same issue? Do you have any recommendations on carriers to ship bulky items? We cannot go 100% 3PL yet as we still need to inspect and test all units before shipping to the customer, so we need a carrier that could deliver our packages, similar to what UPS does.\n\nThanks!!",

He\u2019s committed to shipping the truck but is unsure of the best strategy. Here are some options he\u2019s considering:\n\n1. **Find a company near Hamilton/Toronto/Niagara** that can take care of everything from this location.\n\n2. **Ship from a Canadian port:** The closest ports are Halifax on the Atlantic or possibly Quebec/Montreal. However, this would mean the vehicle would arrive in Mexico\u2019s Gulf Coast, and then need to be transported across the country to the Pacific coast (Manzanillo).\n\n3. **Cross the border and ship from the U.S.:** He could drive the truck into the U.S. (e.g., New York State) and have it picked up by an American company. \n\nHe wants to avoid driving the vehicle himself across the U.S. and Mexico at all costs and is seeking a reliable freight company that can handle this.\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions on the best approach or know of any companies that specialize in this kind of shipment? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

Our job essentially is to keep inventory of spare parts, process any and all parts that get delivered and determine which aircraft/ hangar they need to go to (there are 3), and perform regular deliveries every few hours to drop off said parts at the correct locations so the mechs can continue working. The reason I\u2019m writing is because our current way of tracking what parts are leaving our warehouse or going from one hangar to another is a glorified excel sheeting with just the work order # on it. I would like to know if anyone has used or knows of an app/ software we could look into, because some of these parts are $100k+ and I would know exactly where they are if/when someone comes looking for them instead of digging through work orders that may or may not have multiple things on them.

        "content": "Putting my first comment here so the community understands why i posted it\n\nFor the community; does your businesses try balance the adoption of technology with the need for maintaining flexibility and adaptability in their supply chains? Or this is not in the focus now?\n\nI recently had the privilege of attending the IMD Leading the Future Supply Chain program, an experience that not only reinforced my commitment to continuous learning but also opened up new perspectives on the transformative direction supply chain management is headed. One of the key themes explored was the advent of Supply Chain 5.0 and its integration with Industry 4.0 technologies.\n\nWhat is Supply Chain 5.0?\n\nSupply Chain 5.0 can be seen as the evolutionary step that builds upon the foundations laid by Industry 4.0. While Industry 4.0 focuses on digital transformation through IoT, AI, robotics, and big data, Supply Chain 5.0 emphasizes the human-centric approach. It harmonizes cutting-edge technology with human intelligence, creativity, and decision-making capabilities to create a more resilient, adaptable, and sustainable supply chain.\n\nWhy is This Relevant to Industry 4.0?\n\nIndustry 4.0 has given us the tools to automate, optimize, and digitize supply chains, leading to increased efficiency and visibility. However, Supply Chain 5.0 pushes this further by integrating the human touch. It highlights the importance of collaboration between advanced digital systems and human expertise to enhance problem-solving, drive innovation, and respond more effectively to rapid market changes.\n\nThe Future of Supply Chain: People and Technology Working Together\n\nAs discussed in the program, the true power of Supply Chain 5.0 lies in collaborative intelligence\u2014leveraging machine learning and AI for data analysis while empowering humans to interpret and apply this data with creativity and strategic thinking. This approach not only improves operational efficiency but also ensures that supply chain practices are aligned with sustainability and ethical considerations, addressing the growing consumer and regulatory focus on responsible business practices.\n\nKey Takeaways from the IMD Program:\n\nDigital Transformation is Essential, but Human Insight is Irreplaceable: Technology should amplify human capability, not replace it.\n\nSustainability and Resilience Go Hand-in-Hand: Supply Chain 5.0 enables organizations to design systems that are both efficient and socially responsible.\n\nPreparedness for the Unexpected: Integrating human intelligence with real-time data analysis helps in anticipating disruptions and building agile responses.\n\n\nAs we move forward, it\u2019s clear that the future of supply chain management will be a blend of high-tech innovation and human intuition. I look forward to sharing more insights on how we can apply these learnings to our own operations and continue to drive progress in this exciting field.\n\nLet\u2019s embrace the journey toward a more connected, adaptive, and human-centric supply chain! \ud83e\udd1d\ud83d\udca1\n",

Where we are currently at as an industry, it is impossible to get to the full actualization of Industry 4.0 without integrating the principles of Supply Chain 5.0. This is due to the reasons you mentioned; human insight is still irreplaceable within the supply chain world.\n\nToday, the most effective way to implement Industry 4.0 is to start from a human-centric approach - understanding existing human work processes and integrating digital solutions to enhance/accelerate them (rather than replacing them altogether). \n\nIt'll take a long time before we are truly able to remove the human element out of the equation. Until then, we need to understand how to best mesh man and machine together.",

We owned 3 retail outlets and a small wholesale facility where we made dough, sauce, and cheese for several licensed locations. I personally owned and ran one of the retail stores for 10 years and was mainly responsible for the other businesses for about 5-6 years. We sold everything in 2022, and I took an accounting manager position at a 3PL company.\n\nThe 3PL company I currently work for has 4 warehouses spread out along the East Coast, plus a trucking company. Most of our trucking is for draying containers from the ports to store in our warehouses. I also help manage a new sugar import business alongside one of the C-suite officers. We import sugar from overseas and resell it by the metric ton in the U.S. My role is mainly focused on costing and accounting.\n\nWhile I'm good at accounting, I don\u2019t really enjoy it and don\u2019t see much of a future at the small company I\u2019m at now. I\u2019ve been hearing a lot about SC being a good field to get into, and that my accounting, operations management, and procurement skills would transfer well. But I haven\u2019t had much luck with my applications over the past few months.\n\nRecently, I landed an interview for a buyer position at a major food distributor here in the Philly area. I\u2019m looking for advice on how to frame my experience for this role. I feel like I might be a bit overqualified, but it's a large company, so I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll be able to grow there. Does anyone have any advice or warnings? The Glassdoor salary range for a buyer at this company is $55k-90k. I\u2019m aiming for $75-80k\u2014does that sound realistic?",

I have gotten to a stage in my career where it has become evident that I need a better understanding of inventory management, specifically, understanding how much to buy of certain items year after year after generating sales data. \n\nThe specific predicament I\u2019m in is I am ill-equipped to do. We have a large planning team in charge of establishing Open-To-Buys/Forecasts, but when it comes to me determining optimal inventory levels of specific *products*, I am at a loss. \n\nCan someone point me in the direction of a good online course to learn more and figure this out? Free or paid, either works.\n\nThanks! ",

To really understand everything you want to know, you really do need a degree; you're not going to learn statistics and stochastic simulation and newsvendor models and all the other necessary context from just one course. \n\nHowever, if you only had to understand one thing, you would need to understand how to calculate a re-order point and how to work with that.\n\nIf you're not an expert in data science/forecasting/ML/statistics, you would want to get with someone who is (i.e. in the planning team), and then get them to design a solution to calculate your re-order point (\"ROP\").  That is the minimum \"floor\" of inventory you have, at which point you trigger a replenishment order.\n\nIf your lead time for replenishment (i.e. the time between the point at which you press the \"re-order\" button and the time you receive that replenishment order) is short, then you are in luck and you might be able to greatly simplify this.  If your lead time for replenishment is lengthy or highly variable, you would generally want to use a stochastic simulation to calculate your \"optimal inventory level\" for a *specific product*, which is what you said you wanted to know how to do.\n\nThe way you want to set a re-order point is to calculate the joint conditional probability distribution of the lead time and the demand forecast, and then optimize that according to your desired \"Cycle Service Level\" or CSL.  If your CSL is 90%, then you are trying to set an inventory level that will permit you to remain in stock on that product at least 90% of the time.  You can play with the value to be more or less aggressive.\n\nSkipping over a lot of other details here \u2014 you should lean on your planning and forecasting team about these \u2014 once you have an optimal ROP for each Sku of interest, then you trigger a replenishment order whenever you are at or below the ROP (or close to it).  This is how you manage.\n\nActually implementing this in practice is non-trivial to do, but it can be done.  I have done this for my small wine importing company.  We have long and highly variable lead times and highly seasonal demand for our core products, so the ROP changes as we move through time, according to seasonality.  Honestly, it's easier to manage these things when you can just do it all yourself sometimes \u2014 otherwise you need to coordinate the efforts of a large team, which can sometimes be costly and can eat up budget if you're not careful.",

After that, you need to decide how many days or weeks you feel comfortable having on hand. If you have a high moving item or material that you know has 2 week lead time, then having 3 weeks of inventory might not hurt you. \n\nLook at your suppliers reliability as well. If they\u2019re always shipping on time and in full then you can asume you\u2019ll be ok should you run a bit lean during a peak period or promotion. However, if they\u2019re shorting you and have supply issues, you know to stock up a bit. Safety stock levels will be more important here.",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m 37 and considering a shift into a full-fledged career in Supply Chain Management, but I\u2019ve been worried that I might be too old to make this leap. I\u2019ve been wondering if the industry has any expectations or biases regarding age when it comes to hiring, especially for roles where you may need to work your way up or compete with younger candidates who might have fresh degrees or more up-to-date training.\n\nA little about my background: I\u2019m not coming in without any experience. In fact, I\u2019ve worked extensively in logistics and shipping, both domestically and internationally. I spent several years consulting for companies, where I was deeply involved in streamlining shipping costs, solving backend software issues, and managing daily shipping tasks. I\u2019ve also worked on packaging and quality control for high-profile projects, including handling trophies and awards for NBA.  There, I managed complex shipping operations, from 3PL solutions to EEI filings and harmonized codes, and even coordinated with partners like Kith and BMW.\n\nSo, while I have a strong logistical foundation and experience with high-pressure, precise shipping operations, my concern is whether entering a more structured supply chain role at 37 puts me at a disadvantage. Would companies be willing to take a chance on someone my age, even with a background that\u2019s not \u201ctraditional\u201d supply chain but still highly relevant?\n\nAlso just to add, I went back to school with hopes to transfer next spring to Arizona State University and apply to the SCM program. \n\nJust want some insight on this whole thing.

I've made actual SOPs instead of the handful of handwritten scribbles I was given by the person who trained me.

I\u2019ve spent the last 10 years working in a warehouse, gaining hands-on experience in inventory management, logistics, and team coordination, and I also have a bachelor\u2019s degree. I\u2019ve applied for management positions within the company, but unfortunately I was told they were looking for someone who aligns more closely with all company decisions without much resistance. \n\nI\u2019m exploring opportunities in related fields where I can leverage my skills, contribute meaningfully, and grow professionally. If anyone has suggestions for roles or industries that might be a good fit or advice on making a transition, I\u2019d really appreciate it.\n\nI\u2019m also in a sort of tight financial spot since my gf is in grad school until next spring and my current role is helping keep the bills paid for now. \n\nI\u2019d want to have a game plan starting when my gf graduates ",

I think taking your business in a more strategic direction would be beneficial (ex: analyzing what buckets make up your largest spend, and how to drive those costs down, etc.) I think Coursera has some courses on Supply Chain and procurement that could be beneficial.

        "content": "I have a question regarding inventory management for a central warehouse that fulfills the demands of multiple retail stores based on their aggregate sales.\n\nSpecifically, I\u2019m curious about the best approach to determining the inventory level that triggers the reorder point (ROP) at the warehouse. Should the ROP be based solely on the inventory levels in the central warehouse, or should it also consider the combined inventory levels of all the retail stores it supplies?\n\nAdditionally, would this approach differ if the warehouse operates as a cross-docking facility versus a break-bulk facility?\n\nI appreciate any insights or experiences you can share on this matter!\n\nThank you!\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your replies. I think I might not have been very clear in my original post, or at least I'm still not sure of what the answer is and the reasoning behind it. So I will write an example:\n\n**Retail stores business**\n\nIn our system, a planner sets the minimum and maximum inventory levels for both the warehouse and each individual store, with these levels managed in our ERP system. The min-max levels for the stores are based on their individual demand, while the min-max levels for the warehouse are determined by the total demand of all the stores.\n\nA warehouse places orders to a supplier when it reaches a reorder point (ROP) calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Daily Demand**: Total anticipated usage of the stores based on forecasts.\n2. **Anticipated Lead Time**: Lead time from the supplier to the warehouse plus lead time from the warehouse to the stores.\n3. **Safety Stock**: (Z\u00a0 \u00d7 \u03c3LT \u00d7 DD avg)or some other formula depending on the product)\n\nWhen the net available quantity (on-hand inventory \u2013 committed inventory + current replenishment orders) reaches the reorder point (ROP) an order should be placed.\n\n**Question**: Should the central warehouse place orders based on the net available quantity of the **warehouse only**, or should it place orders based on the **combined net available quantity of both the warehouse and the stores**?\n\nFor example:\n\n* **Warehouse ROP**: 20\n* **Warehouse net available quantity:** 20\n* **Warehouse + stores net available quantity**: 120\n\nDo you place an order because the **warehouse net available quantity** reached the ROP or do you **Not** place an order because the **warehouse + stores net available quantity** is way above the ROP?",

The idea is to check 1-2 cases of item lots on every truck essentially counting, and seeing how many deficiencies you can find while documenting this. Ex how many rotten, bruised or low box counts.  My issue is between meetings, emails and solving logistical issues and monitoring inventory levels for orders I can\u2019t seem we would have the time to manage 20-30mins on every truck (5-7) a day or more. We do periodically check trucks when they come in, if we catch them. I also do daily walks in the warehouse and check product longevity etc. I suggested we hire a QA/inventory person or have the warehouse do this during receiving. We also do not have an inventory management person either. Is this common in the fresh produce distribution industry for buyers to act as QA personal on every inbound trailer? Would a person who manages inventory/QA be reasonable to hire to specialize in this vs relying on buyers? ",

There can be more, but these are the basic ones.\n\nAnd as a QA, your main goals are: mitigate defect parts being detected in the operation and at the customer and report on quality standards of each vendor.\n\nAs you may notice, the role of a QA creates friction in the \u201chappy flow\u201d of a buyer. Therefore, for you to meet the buyer\u2019s goals it might be convenient to overlook quality standards.\n\nPractical example: if the operation is close to stop due to a certain material shortage, and the truck that just arrived at the facility doesn\u2019t pass quality standards, you might feel the need to overlook them in order to not stop the operation and not to affect your buyer\u2019s goals that might affect your bonus.",

        "content": "I've seen a few posts on this, but the ones with responses were from closer to a year ago or from people who didn't have as much experience (I have close to ten years). Plus I know the remote climate has changed for the worst in the past year - especially with all of the recent layoffs (I was a victim). For those of you who managed to get a remote role, what did you do to stand out? I've been working on cover letters as well - does that even do any good? I've spent hours on them and I'm not getting interviews. How long did it take you to get one of those remote roles?\n\nDetails -\n\nI have a lot of experience - almost ten years combined experience in inventory management, capacity planning - involved in S&OP and forecasting, production planning, and unofficial demand planning. I've been an operations manager and have managed teams in two of my roles.  I'm great with Excel and have always had positive feedback on what I've produced. I've created my own forecasting worksheets, even without it being a job requirement, worked on inventory program implementations, have 3-4 years of SAP experience, though most of my specific PRODUCTION planning was using industry-specific MES/APS systems or another older MRP system  (QAD, if anyone has even heard of it - probably not). Still MRP though and I am great at learning new systems. In my last job, we had to suddenly change to a different inventory management system, I had to learn it in a short period of time so I could implement it and train users. In the role before that my boss gave me a computer science intern (turned part time employee/contractor) because I was good on the technical piece - including my SAP experience and our complicated forecast/capacity spreadsheet. We were working on together on automating the process before the company decided they couldn't afford him anymore. This sounds like a resume/cover letter without the numbers, doesn't it?\n\nAll this to say, I have great experience, but I don't really know what to do to get myself out there. The only thing I am really missing is specific sourcing/vendor management. I've been involved in both, including directly communicating with suppliers/vendors, even working on RFQs and determining outsource suppliers and negotiating prices, I've just never been officially in the role of managing vendors or sourcing at a corporate level. I can't help but think that might be killing me, but I can't be the only person who was able to get a job that has all of the relevant experience the job is looking for without having a specific piece.  I posted something similar in another group and someone suggested looking at IBP roles because of my broad experience, which is where my interest mostly is anyways, but either way, I still have to stand out among the hundreds of other candidates with a lot of experience.\n\nA caveat - I am completely fine working in-office, I did it in my last role and prior to that I was hybrid -  but  I moved for the job to somewhere for my previous role to an area with a limited job market. I am looking locally, but the jobs that even come close to what I was making that use my skillset are in healthcare, and I don't have healthcare experience.  I'm talking... most jobs are $50K off less than what I was making with a degree from what most consider Ivy League and an MBA. It's expensive out here so I can't go back to making what I was making when I only had a few years of experience and was paying significantly less for a place to live.",

Successful brands and retailers know that optimal inventory turnover requires a mix of smart sourcing, the right vendor partnerships, accurate demand planning, and advanced tech for forecasting and tracking.\n\nSome of the most innovative brands leverage their inventory turnover as a competitive edge. Outside the US, retailers like Primark and Zudio from Trent Ltd are perfect examples. Primark turns inventory about 10 times a year, and that too without resorting to e-commerce. Zudio, in India, achieves an impressive 14 turns annually, keeping their product offerings fresh and minimizing markdowns. Their ability to manage inventory flow helps them stay ahead in highly competitive markets.\n\nWhat are some other great inventory turnover stories?",

It was not a long-term solution.\n\nPlenty of manufacturing companies run with low inventoeies and quick changeovers.  10 turns is really not particuarly impressive, most companies just don't care too much.  I ran a paper plant for a year with less than 10 calendar days on hand.  At 15 we had to use outside storage warehouses.  The hardest part is convincing managment that 2 days down a month is better than 24 all at once at the end of the year when they finally realize the product isn't selling to capacity. God help you if they use GM accounting.\n\nWalmart sells their product before they pay for it, essentially running a float on suppliers' money.\n\nThe reality is that warehousing costs for most businesses are way less than COGS, so there is only so much juice to get from the squeeze.  If this were not true, we wouldn't import so much from Asia to the US, that supply chain is terrible, but we do it and run larger inventory as a result because cost of goods is typically an order of magnitude larger than warehousing period costs.  If you don't have cash flow problems, you usually dont care.",

        "content": "Hello All,\n\nI started my career in SCM Back Office in India for a Swiss chemical company. After that, I worked in Master Data, Analytics (mainly preparing various Excel reports), Supply Chain Analytics (creating reports within the supply chain), and as a Demand and Inventory Manager (handling both supply/demand planning and inventory management). For the past few years, I've been working as a Global Pricing Analyst, accumulating around 12 years of work experience in total.\n\nI have experience with Excel (including macros), Power BI, am nearly finished learning Python, and also have basic knowledge of SQL.\n\nNow, I am looking to transition back into the supply chain domain and want to explore advanced supply chain topics where I can apply my analytics skills.\n\nI'm considering the following options and would appreciate your advice:\n\n1. CPIM: Here, I would learn in-depth about inventory management, scheduling, and planning. I believe that with this advanced knowledge, I can leverage my analytics skills to add value to my role, especially given my experience in planning and inventory management.\n\n\n2. CSCP: I\u2019ve read that this certification is more recognized and valuable compared to CPIM. However, CSCP covers many topics I am less interested in, such as sourcing and logistics. Does CSCP cover planning and inventory management in enough detail? My next role will likely focus on planning and inventory management.\n\n\n3. MITx Supply Chain Management (edX): This program looks comprehensive and relatively affordable. However, I\u2019ve seen comments suggesting that MITx may not hold as much weight on a resume, and recruiters might not shortlist me for interviews based on it.\n\n\n4. Coursera/Other Courses: I also have access to Coursera Plus for a year, so I could complete courses like Supply Chain Analytics (Rutgers), Supply Chain Excellence (Rutgers), and Leveraging Data Science for a More Agile Supply Chain (University of California) at no extra cost. Additionally, I have several Udemy courses on SCM KPIs, inventory management, and planning. I could complete these courses and hope for an opportunity to showcase my knowledge in an interview.\n\n\n\nI would appreciate your feedback and advice on which path might be the best for me.\n\nMany thanks in advance!\n",

More useful for planners.\n\n\nCSCP has a large overlap with CPIM in materials (you won't lose out on substance by taking either, especially if the knowledge area you want is somewhere between S&OP and MRP).\u00a0However, what they ask & emphasize in the quizzes and questions are often different.\n\n\nIf you want to take only 1, go CSCP. You will eventually be a manager, you may not stay a planner forever.\n\n\nIf money isn't concern, I'd say take one and then refresh your memory a few yrs later with the other one (e.g., take CPIM, then start CSCP 3 yrs later).\n\n\nMicroMaster complements both because it extends what you know with advanced math stuffs like Holt Winters.\n\n\nPurely for resume? APICS is better. Not because of the substance (all are equally good), but because APICS keyword carries more weight.",

                "body": "Looks like you\u2019re in a great position with your current SC skills! What\u2019s your educational background?\n\nI usually recommend starting with CSCP if you're looking for a quicker certification, especially if you're transitioning from another field or don't have a degree. But, based on your experience and considering your next role will likely focus on planning and inventory management, CPIM might be the better option for you.\n\nCPIM takes around 4-6 months to complete (with 3 textbooks), and it covers planning and inventory in much greater depth. CSCP, which takes 3-4 months (with 2 textbooks), does touch on those topics, but not in as much detail as CPIM. If you start with CPIM, CSCP will feel easier afterward.\n\nAs for Coursera courses, in your case, I'd recommend skipping them. They provide basic information but might be too easy given your experience. Instead, I'd focus on certifications like CPIM, CSCP, or even the MITx Supply Chain courses, which are much more recognized in the industry. MITx\u2019s SC0x (Analytics) and SC1x (Fundamentals) would offer more value, especially with your analytics background.\n\nThat said, I recommend starting with an ASCM certification like CPIM or CSCP before diving into MITx. Once you have that foundational knowledge, you can then take the **MITx SC1x Supply Chain Fundamentals** course. Despite the name, it\u2019s not really an introductory class\u2014it's quite challenging! But it would complement your ASCM studies and provide a deeper dive into supply chain topics\n\nThe **MITx MicroMasters in Principles of Manufacturing** could also be worth exploring\u2014it aligns closely with CPIM\u2019s focus on inventory and planning, but with a slightly different approach. Boths MM programs typically take just over a year to complete, and you can re-evaluate your path after completing a few courses, deciding whether to pursue another ASCM certification, continue with MITx, or even consider a master\u2019s degree.\n\nBoth CSCP and CPIM both have a free demo of the first module of the course. Additionally, the MITx MM classes can be audited for free or pay $100 to $200 USD with a discount code to get the cert/credits.\n\nLastly, other certs like the IBF CPF (Forecasting), Lean Six Sigma Green Belt, or PMP could be valuable down the line. If you go with CPIM, you're already covering many of the key concepts in Lean Six Sigma, so grabbing a Green Belt afterward would be a smart move.\n\nGood luck!",

You\u2019re going to have to go entry level on a new area if you want to get into supply chain management. I\u2019d maybe build off that materials coordinator bit and maybe try to get into purchasing or procurement or something along those lines.\n\nAnd the whole \u2018project management\u2019 thing is tough\u2026a lot of PM work is contract or temporary work. You\u2019d want to get a PMP certification to do that. You need to have a ton of experience, since you\u2019re generally being asked to do a lot of optimization work, compliance work, implementing changes etc all of which require an intimate base knowledge of whatever field you work in.

My plan is to stay in this role for about a year or two to gain some hands-on experience in the manufacturing field.\n\nI\u2019m really interested in transitioning into the supply chain/logistics field and would love some advice on how to make this switch. What steps should I take to break into this industry? \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve been looking into getting some certifications, like the Certified Supply Chain Professional (CSCP) or Certified in Production and Inventory Management (CPIM).\n\nThanks!",

                "body": "Posted this the other day for someone:\n\nBut, first, you might want to look at getting a lean six sigma green belt since you are working as a machine adjuster now. CPIM will align more with what you are doing now, but CSCP will be a bit easier. Either way laying down a good LSS foundation will help you in your current job and on the CSCP and the CPIM exams.\n\nASCM offers two major certifications: **CSCP** and **CPIM**. If you're deciding where to start, I\u2019d recommend beginning with **CSCP**, as it tends to be a bit easier due to its shorter length in terms of textbooks.\n\n* **CSCP**: Focuses on the broader supply chain, including suppliers, production, and distribution. It\u2019s great for those looking to understand end-to-end supply chain operations.\n   * **Study Material**: Only 2 books to cover.\n   * **Time to Complete**: Typically takes about 3 to 6 months to finish.\n* **CPIM**: Dives deeper into planning and inventory management within the manufacturing process. Ideal for those focused on production and operations management.\n   * **Study Material**: 3 books to cover.\n   * **Time to Complete**: Generally takes about 4 to 8 months to finish.\n\nChoosing between them depends on your career goals\u2014CSCP for a broader supply chain perspective and CPIM for specialized knowledge in production and inventory management.\n\n**Lean Six Sigma** concepts are also integrated throughout ASCM's materials. To build a strong foundation, consider starting with a **free White Belt** certification from the **CSSC**. From there, you can progress to Yellow Belt and Green Belt. All the books are free to download on their site \\[[Link](https://www.sixsigmacouncil.org/six-sigma-white-belt-certification/)\\]. The WB book will only take you 1 to 2 days to read.\n\nASCM has a free demo of CSCP module 1, so check it out for free and see what you think about it \\[[Link](https://www.ascm.org/lp/cscp-free-demo/)\\]. Remember to use a promo code and become a member to save money.\n\nHot tips: Use Pocket Prep questions everyday, get a reading app to listen to the material, read the The Machine That Changed the World, The Toyota Way and The Goal.",

Yes I know experience is something I need to focus on first, I agree and understand, but as I figure out the long term plan it can me progress in what jobs I would want to take in the future that would be most beneficial towards those goals.

I work in procurement and have studied CompSci so feel like I can answer this question.   \n  \nAs a result of being a function of an organsation - supply chain is limited to ventures that involve 'problem solving' for other organisations. This basically pigeon holes you into consultancy or developing SaaS platforms to deliver solutions if you are staying under the umbrella of Supply Chain.\n\nAs you get experience, you can gain the skillset required to partner with someone and start a venture in any type of physical goods.\n\nRe consulting - From my experience logistics is the furthest ahead in regard to technology adoption and outsourcing, but I believe predictive analytics is going to become industry standard for all businesses that have an S&OP process as well as further afield in SC so its anyones game going fwd.",

The process you describe is consistent with that, but obviously very manual. \n\nFor comparison, I'll share a basic indirect buyer process in our business, but it does not reflect all potential process variations or distinctions between 'large' and 'small' or capex vs non capex purchase procurement. For context, we run ~500,000 PO's across ~$2B of indirect and capital spending. My cloud team built and implemented the new processes using a mix of new and existing technologies, my procurement team handles most but not all procurement, and my ops (buyer) team is responsible for execution under a shared services model, however not all businesses are using all of the functionalities yet \n\n\n1. A member of the company needs an item\n1. They create a **requisition** in our Cloud procurement system. If the product/service needed is from one of 40+ ecommerce enabled suppliers, the requester uses an integrated shopping tool to search across suppliers for the best price, given lead time and other factors. \n1. If the request is for a higher value material or service, they submit a requisition with attachments showing any prior quotes obtained or suppliers identified. The request is handed off to the sourcing team to manage a negotiation, or preferably, a reverse auction with qualified suppliers.  \n1. The awarded supplier and firm cost is identified in the requisition. Payment terms are defined based upon system setup and/or sourcing event terms and conditions. \n1. The requisition is sent electronically to be approved by the budget owner and potentially higher levels based upon the value of the purchase. The approver can approve via email. \n1. The requisition is automatically converted into a purchase order, and sent via XML integration if an ecommerce supplier or direct from system .pdf/email. \n1. The buyer receives either an email or electronic order confirmation from the supplier \n1. The requester receives both an approval notification and supplier acknowledgement with expected ETA\n1. The PO is 'received' by the requisitioner upon delivery or completion of services\n1. Invoices are automatically converted to text via OCR and matched to the PO and receipt (3 way match on all PO's). Unmatched invoices that require POs under our PO policy are escalated to procurement for triage. Invoices against un-recieved invoices/PO's trigger automated notifications to the requester to please update receipt status.  \n\n\nRoadmap technology and business process plans include:\n\n* Bid-via-email, with means to provide market feedback via email, to reduce supplier setup and training time in Ariba. \n \n* Reverse auction and bid via email prices will automatically be converted to agreements with lines that can be matched/fed into the purchase order price lines\n\n* Toolcrib software replenishment signals will be integrated to Cloud to auto-create purchase orders which are then matched to supplier invoices. Deliveries can be received and put-away using pre-printed bar-coded receipts. Bin doors in vending machines are programmed to automatically open based upon put-away receipts (\"put-away to light\" similar to 'pick to light' systems)\n \n* We will receive electronic ASN (Automated ship notification), updating expected delivery dates. Receiving of goods will be automated based upon ASN; final delivery confirmation. \n  \n* Invoices for key ecommerce enabled suppliers will be electronically sent via XML and auto-reconciled to the purchase price. \n\n* We will benchmark and re-negotiate complex Statements of Work projects using AI driven software (already being tested) on a time and hours basis.\n\n* Integrated Supplier portal will be available for well qualified suppliers enabling them to view payment status, update contact details, submit compliance disclosures, manually update ship and intransit status and submit requests to change billing information.",

To be honest, it is just a bit shy from what i expected like 2-3% less (at first got a bit sad tbh until i did some research and thinking) but if i look at the market, this seems like more or less right salary for someone with my experience as i have never did this job and my total experience in supply chain is just 6-7 years 4 of them as supervisor. And i feel like the title i will get would bring more than the salary.\n\nTitle would be \"procurement and s&op manager\" (manager of managers, with two managers + around 10 indirect employees)\n\nAge:31\n\nForbes 500 company, in EU.\n\nSome important responsibilities: working with senior managers that i have never worked before + corporate as i will be responsible for inventory of the business unit. 24 months s&op, 30m $ stock+fob at any time, yearly around 6-7m $ logistics budget, two distribution centers in EMEA, yearly sales 250m$, every year new product introductions with phase in/out.\n\nPast role experience: managing a remote team of buyers, process owner for SC, did SAP implementation (as bpo), moved production and distribution center to different countries.\n\nFuture: will implement a new business planning tool in a year or two.\n\nMy aim is to go further like most of us. Could we say that i am on the right track and this new job/title would open further opportunities? Because from looking at the job market, lots of companies look for people with \"s&op\" management experience.\n\nEdit: as someone pointed out, this is really not flexing but we can agree that i am looking for validation of \"you are doing fine\" feeling that we all look for.",

Currently, its all a manual process that involves a lot of back-and-forth with my co-packer and managing many spreadsheets.\n\nI'm brainstorming an inventory management software solution specifically designed for food businesses like mine:\n\nHere's what I am thinking:\n\n**Iventory Tracking**: The software tracks the quantity and location of all ingredients used in your food products, providing real-time visibility into inventory levels across all ingredients.\n\n**Automated Reordering**: The system automatically generates purchase orders for ingredients when stock levels dip below a certain threshold. This eliminates manual ordering and helps prevent stockouts.\n\n**Recipe Management**: Allows you to specify ingredient quantities based on your product formulations. The system can then use this information to automate order generation based on production plans.\n\n**Copacker Integration**: Integrates with systems used by co-packers to facilitate seamless information flow and automate some communication between you and your co-packer.\n\nQuestions for you:\n\n* What are your biggest challenges with current inventory management systems?\n* How do you currently handle reordering and tracking of ingredients?\n* Would automated reordering and real-time inventory tracking be valuable to you?\n* How important is integration with co-packers and recipe management for your business?\n\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated!",

I figure supply chain would be easiest for me to start a career in, because win already in it. I worked in retail operations/inventory management (for only one store), and now I do b2b wholesale stuff for a very small fashion/apparel company. Love my job. But no benefits and I\u2019m sometimes living paycheck to paycheck. I\u2019m going to go back to school, my local highly rated community college, for an associates in supply chain management. This was a hard decision for me because I\u2019ve struggled with school in the past but I really want to change.\n\nI can get an associates and not take on any debt, a bachelors I will have to go in to debt for. So I would rather just start with an associates and then see how things go with my finances moving forward. \n\nTo make real money, I know tech and energy pay well. I know nothing about either of these. I didn\u2019t have a lot of guidance or mentorship growing up and about how to apply and navigate college, so I\u2019m kind of overwhelmed but I really want to figure this out. What\u2019s the best way to be taught about these supply chain industries? If I go into debt and get a bachelors, would I be trying for a degree in SCM and computer science? If that\u2019s what it takes I can probably figure out the money thing. I\u2019d really really appreciate at least a little direction. ",

Should I focus on skilling up with certifications like CSCP or CPIM alongside job hunting ?

I might consider this after getting a CSCP or CPIM for additional knowledge.\n\nCPIM would probably be the better of the two main ASCM certs. But, CPIM is a grind and it will take about 6 to 12 months of studying to complete it. CSCP will be a bit easier and quicker to do. It should take 4-6 months to complete. Ask ChatGPT to compare the two certs. Really have it break it down for you so you can make an informed decision.   \n  \nFrom what you described in your job duties and what you are capable of doing it could be time to start thinking about a masters. Look into the MITx MicroMasters program there is a class that is close to what CTSC is trying offer, and you won't have to learn it from a stuffy-boring text book.

I'm curious whether a certain team area may have more future pay potential, industry demand, or flexibility for my career! I\u2019m not exactly sure what I want to do, but I\u2019ve heard demand planning has a lot of pay potential.\n\n**Possible Team Placements Include:**\n\n**Castlegate Forwarding**\n\nCastleGate Forwarding is a digital freight forwarding organization within Wayfair's broader CastleGate Logistics network.

Google it and you should find a vendor in your country. The main thing with glass packaging is to make sure it is wrapped with a material that is spongy enough (not very stiff paper) to absorb impact but stiff enough to hold the jar in place inside the box. So if you\u2019re using paper bubble wrap, make sure its outer packaging is not loose - like a courier poly bag. It should be a box and the wrapping should be enough that it fits firmly inside the box without moving about.",

In addition to that it's a very complex area and even those materials deemed \"biodegradable\" probably won't at home, only in special industrial composting facilities that generally don't exist and any packaging haa very little chance of actually reaching one.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAs the other comment says for sustainability you need to look at materials, likely strong plastic pouches that are fully recyclable. But, anything too flimsy or \"film\" or thin in my experience won't be recycled. You can see though from the comments that experience differs widely.\u00a0 \u00a0If it means anything in the UK a couple of the major English tea brands surprisingly just have teabags in a carton, though a well developed one that would let less air in, though most have a foil or cellophane bag in the box filled with about 20-50 tea bags.\u00a0 If this was me selling these teabags I would consider trying to implement either a recyclable strong stand up pouch or a very thin cellophane bag which goes in a well designed carton with a cutout to act as a window\u00a0",

Many companies prefer packaging materials that align with their brand colors or convey a sense of cleanliness and professionalism.\n3. **Environmental Concerns**: Some black packing peanuts may contain dyes or additives that could potentially harm the environment. Lighter-colored, biodegradable packing peanuts are often preferred for their eco-friendly properties.\n4. **Manufacturing Process**: Producing black packing peanuts may require additional steps or materials compared to standard white or biodegradable options, potentially increasing production costs.",

I'm on the hunt for pizza box producers who can offer **competitive pricing** and **reasonable quality**, with an emphasis on **lower Minimum Order Quantities (MOQs)**.\n\nOur clients range from small pizzerias to larger chains, so flexibility in order size is key. We're looking to establish a long-term relationship with a supplier who understands the dynamics of a wholesale business like ours.\n\nHere's what we're ideally looking for:\n\n1. **Competitive Pricing:** As we all know, margins can be tight in this business, so cost-effectiveness is crucial.\n2. **Quality:** We don't want to compromise on the quality. The boxes should be sturdy, hold up well during delivery, and ideally be eco-friendly.\n3. **Low MOQs:** We need a supplier who is flexible with order sizes, as our client needs can vary significantly.\n4. **Customization Options:** Bonus points if they offer customization options for branding purposes.\n\nIf you've had positive experiences with any suppliers or know of any that fit this bill, I'd greatly appreciate your recommendations. Also, any tips on what to look out for or avoid would be super helpful!\n\nThanks in advance for your help! Let's help each other grow our businesses.  \n\n\nI am from Europe, so suppliers from this area are recommended. ",

        "content": "Nowadays Cardboard prices have increased by 60% to 70% as compared to the year 2021. This situation is eventually augmenting the custom packaging cost, which has become quite challenging for all the discrete sectors attached to it.\n\nThat's why ppl are looking for other packaging ways alternatives to cardboard boxes which they can use to move their stuff without spending too much of their budget.\n\nSo Here are some of the [Alternative to Cardboard Boxes](https://boxagency.co/blog/why-cardboard-boxes-are-expensive/) that you can try today:\n\n\\-  **Seaweed Packaging**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y4f23ogyqn1c1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=2deaa20998fcca3d534d072350d0999f246334da\n\nThe package production companies are immensely focusing on the production of seaweed packaging. Gelatin is extracted from the seaweeds to generate this type of packaging material, which is quite similar to cornstarch in its functionality.\n\n\\-  **Cornstarch Packaging**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1yrk8qr0rn1c1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=e152cb285307b618dadb5921107f4a5e2a7db71b\n\nCornstarch packaging is nothing different from plastic packaging but is eco-friendly in nature as it is extracted from corn crops. You could effortlessly decide the dimensions of the cornstarch package depending on the shape and size of the product. Cornstarch packaging material is used to generate solid bottles as well as loose bags.\n\nOne drawback of producing cornstarch packages is that it\u2019s contending with the need for corn in the food industry.\n\n\\-  **Mushroom Packaging**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/09djv563rn1c1.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=24994f80ca4895844086d488df56f6127540d210\n\nMushroom packaging is produced from the inedible part of the mushroom roots. These are best to use in comparison to seaweed packaging and cornstarch packaging. The production of such type of packaging is quite affordable as they are extracted from the least concerned part of mushrooms.\n\n\\-  **Edible Packaging Material**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/naegq016rn1c1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3a10c31f07896849e218202da450402cf219d3d\n\nEdible packaging material is available in various shapes and forms. These are deliberated to keep the consumers safe from the hassle of discarding packages. These are created to be eaten by potential customers.\n\n\\- **Biodegradable Air Peanuts**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/71guod68rn1c1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c7b75c525ec27e9883b75ed7d64a93d9cae463e\n\nBiodegradable air peanuts are small loose fills keeping sensitive products safe from any sort of shock or destruction. These tiny air peanuts are environmentally friendly while keeping nature protected from hazardous substances. These are a great alternative to Styrofoam, which is used as fillers in the packaging of various products.",

Because of this, our team is under a lot of pressure tackling unnecessary issues on an everyday basis.\n\n The corporate cannot replace the system since its been used by other locations as well. \n\nBut however, I was wondering if I could integrate an API between the inhouse system that we have and a modern warehouse management system, that could talk to each other and reconcile information.\n\nAlso, we already have a lot of equipment like multiple handheld mobile scanners running on android, barcode printers, wearable barcode scanners which was ordered by a previous employee but never used because the equipment cannot be integrated with the inhouse system that we have.\n\nPlease suggest me the best way to tackle this, and I would appreciate if anybody could suggest me a good warehouse management/ inventory tracking software to integrate all of the equipment.\n\n  \nThanks and Regards.\n\n",

        "title": "Why Choosing a Warehouse Management System over Computer Vision Could Be Your Best Decision Yet?",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/v3o0oqfeoctd1.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cd4804bb80d6d6cb7fd80c1dfba37c8eff2f836\n\nImagine walking into a warehouse where everything runs smoothly. Packages are organized, orders are processed quickly, and every team member knows exactly what to do, because they are equipped with the right tools. Now, picture trying to achieve that same efficiency by just watching security camera footage all day. Which scenario seems more practical and effective?\n\nBusinesses have many options when it comes to improving their operations. Two popular technologies are Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) and Computer Vision. Let's dive into why investing in a WMS might be the smarter move for your company.\n\n# Keeping Costs Manageable\n\nOne of the primary considerations for any company adopting new technologies is the cost of implementation and maintenance. When comparing WMS to Computer Vision, the difference in cost and implementation complexity is significant.\n\nWhen you're considering new technology, cost is always a big factor. A WMS typically costs between $100,000 and $500,000, depending on your needs. Once it's set up, maintenance is straightforward with regular software updates and minimal hardware changes. Most companies can get a WMS up and running in a few months.\n\nOn the other hand, Computer Vision requires a hefty initial investment in cameras, sensors, and specialized software. Maintenance involves continuous calibration and can become expensive over time. Implementation can take up to 2 years, mainly collecting data for training, with lots of testing to make sure everything works correctly.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a0wxhgzdnctd1.png?width=2024&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d9a36f025446bb756f4ec0162e29f904c84de1a\n\nWMS generally delivers ROI within 12-18 months, while Computer Vision can take years to break even due to the high hardware and software costs involved ([Inbound Logistics \u201cTop Five Ways Warehouse Management Systems Deliver ROI\u201d](https://www.inboundlogistics.com/articles/top-five-ways-warehouse-management-systems-deliver-roi/)).\n\n# Boosting Efficiency Where It Counts\n\nWMS can significantly improve how your warehouse operates. It automates tasks, helps manage inventory better, and speeds up order processing.\u00a0\n\nWhile Computer Vision is great for specific tasks like quality control, it doesn't offer the same broad benefits. It might catch errors but doesn't prevent them in the first place. Many industry professionals view Computer Vision as a helpful tool to use alongside other systems, rather than a standalone solution.\n\nWMS offers significant productivity gains by automating workflows, improving inventory management, and optimizing order processing. Computer Vision, while useful for certain tasks like monitoring, lacks the full operational control that WMS offers.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s372dikknctd1.png?width=2024&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba326f4fd45fdd0512868ed4d61e1c1ca99ffbd\n\nPlease use this link to view referenced article: [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/industry-4-0/warehousing-distributed-center-operations.html)\n\nThe study from McKinsey shows that companies using WMS see an average of a 15-20% increase in warehouse productivity compared to those relying solely on manual systems or limited automation technologies like Computer Vision ([Flevy Management Insights Q&A \u201cWhat emerging trends in warehouse workforce management are shaping the future of labor efficiency and satisfaction?\u201d](https://flevy.com/topic/warehousing/question/future-warehouse-workforce-management-emerging-trends-impacts?srsltid=AfmBOopw6CNbz62aYUhm9ZjLClrn-vpgVDjOHMtk59ZsrEHlkyWFYv17)).\n\n# Growing with Your Business\n\nAs your company grows, your systems need to keep up. A WMS is built to handle increased volume and complexity without missing a beat. Its flexible structure allows you to scale operations smoothly, adding new features or capabilities as needed.\n\nComputer Vision doesn't adapt quite as easily. Scaling requires buying more hardware and making complex adjustments, which quickly adds to both costs and implementation time. This lack of scalability is a significant downside for businesses that plan to grow.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8jlkaptnctd1.png?width=2024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3f22f3dc8c9399cf03d1785e9787481a91e2660\n\nGartner\u2019s research on warehouse automation highlights WMS as a solution that can easily integrate with other systems, enabling smoother scaling as businesses grow.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pr0vgypioctd1.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e1f5c807d7234c3417d046ec62e62293f030412\n\n# Making the Most of Your Data\n\nData-driven decision-making is essential in today\u2019s warehouses. WMS provides advanced analytics and seamless data integration with other enterprise systems, while Computer Vision primarily generates visual data that requires further processing to extract actionable insights.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b61yk7dnoctd1.png?width=2024&format=png&auto=webp&s=206e56c4737805ee18bde999717be9ff48aa0416\n\nThe report from Supply Chain Dive suggests that WMS excels in real-time analytics, allowing companies to make faster, more informed decisions.\n\n# The Better Investment\n\nWhen comparing Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) to Computer Vision, WMS stands out as the superior choice for most businesses due to its cost-effectiveness, implementation speed, scalability, and overall impact on operations. While Computer Vision is valuable in certain niche applications, it does not provide the same comprehensive warehouse management capabilities as a WMS.\n\nBut mainly, Computer Vision can complement sensors and cameras, providing valuable insights; however, it should be noted that video footage alone is insufficient. For example, if Computer Vision is deployed in a warehouse, the camera alone, without proper event recording, will not clarify which employee took specific items. It is crucial to track information, event registrations, and movements within the warehouse. While a fully integrated Warehouse Management System (WMS) would handle this comprehensively, it's important to recognize the high cost and complexity of WMS implementation.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s worth considering a simpler solution that can be quickly implemented in the warehouse, allowing warehouse workers to instantly register stock movements. For instance, [**Cleverence software**](https://www.cleverence.com?utm_source=reddit&utm_term=07.10_Why_Choosing_WMS) offers an efficient way to monitor and record all warehouse activity with 100% accuracy. You'll know which employee, at what time, and from which area the order was processed. Cleverence allows you to track sudden or unusual movements, ensuring accurate order processing and faster deliveries. This not only saves time in the warehouse management chain, from receiving goods to loading them, but it also spares you from the expense of complex WMS systems.\n\nWith Cleverence, you only need mobile handheld devices and barcoded goods. The software will handle the rest, automatically recording every detail about warehouse operations.\n\nThis streamlined approach could save you substantial costs while ensuring precise tracking and improving operational efficiency.",

        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/i36eg5drqsnd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eab9026995dea948d6dd620fffd3faac1b5999fc\n\n# What is Automation in Inventory and Asset Management?\n\nBusinesses require precise and efficient management of inventory and assets. Cleverence automates these essential operations using technology solutions such as barcodes, auto-ID mobile devices, ERP integration and business process automation, directly addressing the need for accuracy and time efficiency in inventory and asset management.\n\nBarcodes, auto-ID technologies and ERP integration are foundational to automating inventory and asset management. These tools streamline data capture, significantly reducing errors associated with manual data entry.\n\nBarcodes, when scanned, accurately capture data without the discrepancies commonly associated with manual entry. This precision is crucial in maintaining reliable inventory levels and asset tracking.\n\nAuto-ID mobile devices eliminate the guesswork and constant back-and-forth with a central database or paperwork, streamlining operations.\n\nERP Integration is crucial for seamless data flow and management and is core for the whole thing to be called an automation. \n\nData capture automation focuses on the initial step of digitizing information. In the context of inventory and asset management, this typically involves using barcode scanners or RFID readers to automatically collect data about products, assets, or transactions. This automation level is primarily about converting physical data (like the identity or quantity of an item) into a digital format quickly and accurately.\n\nBusiness process automation (like Cleverence) encompasses a broader scope, automating the end-to-end processes that drive business operations. BPA integrates various systems and technologies to streamline workflows, reduce manual intervention, and enable real-time decision-making and action based on the data captured.\n\n# Why Customers Choose Cleverence?\n\n[Cleverence](https://www.cleverence.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_term=article_Inventory&Assets_Management_Business_Processes) offers a superior solution for inventory and asset management automation, outperforming manual processes, existing ERP modules, and custom development options. This chapter outlines the key reasons why customers prefer Cleverence, focusing on its efficiency, integration capabilities, and cost-effectiveness.\n\n# Cleverence vs. Manual Processes\n\nIn the context of inventory and asset automation, \"manual\" refers to processes and tasks that are performed by humans without the aid of end-to-end automated systems or technologies. This can include several activities and methods that are traditionally used in managing inventory and assets, such as:\n\n* Manual Data Entry (with or without barcodes): Inputting data into spreadsheets, databases, or ledgers by hand. This includes recording inventory levels, asset locations, and transaction details. While barcode scanning is a technology, in some manual processes, the information captured by the scanner is manually entered into a system or recorded on paper.\n* Manual Physical Counts: Conducting inventory or asset counts by visually inspecting and tallying items. This often involves using paper lists or spreadsheets to track counts.\n* Paper-Based (PDF-based) Tracking: Utilizing paper documents, such as printed spreadsheets, inventory logs, or asset tags, to manage and track inventory and assets.\n* Manual Reconciliation: Comparing physical inventory counts with recorded inventory data by hand to identify discrepancies.\n* Visual Inspections: Checking the condition or presence of assets through physical inspection without the use of digital tools or automated reporting.\n\n[**Try Cleverence for Free**](https://www.cleverence.com/software/for-a-warehouse/wh15/?utm_source=reddit&utm_term=article_Inventory&Assets_Management_Business_Processes)\n\nThe perception that manual processes aided with a barcode scanner constitute \"automation\" stems from the relative improvement these tools offer over entirely manual methods. For many, the introduction of barcode scanners to assist in tasks like inventory management or asset tracking represents a significant step towards digitizing and streamlining their operations. \n\nTrue automation extends beyond the initial data capture, encompassing the entire workflow from data collection to decision-making and action. It involves integrating technologies to create a seamless flow of information that reduces or eliminates the need for manual intervention. \n\nCleverence leverages mobile devices and an app that guides employees through their tasks using real-time data from the ERP system. The integration with an ERP ensures that employees have immediate access to the information they need, such as stock levels, location of items, and task lists, directly on their mobile devices. \n\n* Real-Time Mobile Data Access: Employees can see up-to-date information on inventory levels and asset statuses, allowing for more informed decisions on the spot.\n* Guided Tasks: The app on the mobile device provides a checklist or set of instructions for tasks, ensuring that all necessary steps are completed\u00a0accurately and efficiently.\n\nOnce a task is completed on a mobile device, the data is automatically submitted to the ERP system. This seamless integration means there is no need for manual data entry after the fact, a process that is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors. The immediate transfer of data ensures that inventory and asset records in the ERP system are always current, facilitating better decision-making and planning.\n\n* Elimination of Manual Data Entry: Automatic submission cuts down the workload by removing the need for post-task data entry.\n* Immediate Record Updating: Inventory and asset records are updated in real-time, keeping the ERP system accurate without manual intervention.\n\nLet's break down the concept of doubling efficiency through automation with a more concrete example, focusing on a typical inventory management task:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tepg8bjwqsnd1.png?width=2481&format=png&auto=webp&s=535520a31704c47e87d6d44cfa9354255ef9a9db\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b1fob4w3rsnd1.png?width=2061&format=png&auto=webp&s=078983ac22c793a9b33d9c82f5c1eb1240e636e9\n\n# Cleverence vs. ERP Modules\n\nEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are integral to the operations of many businesses, providing a unified platform for managing various business processes. \n\nHowever, when it comes to specialized functions like auto-ID and logistics barcodes, ERP systems often fall short without significant custom development. Cleverence offers a distinct advantage by bridging these gaps efficiently and effectively.\n\nERP systems are designed to be comprehensive, yet they often lack depth in specific areas such as auto-ID technology and sophisticated logistics management:\n\n* Generic Auto-ID Support: Many ERP systems offer only basic auto-ID functionality, which may not meet the needs of businesses requiring sophisticated barcode or RFID solutions.\n* Limited and Legacy Customization: ERP systems provide limited capabilities for modern mobile app customization, often relying on legacy telnet or inefficient browser technology not well-suited for bursting productivity.\n* Lack of Specialized Logistics Features: Without custom development, ERP modules may not fully support complex logistics operations, such as real-time tracking and advanced warehouse management.\n\nCustomizing ERP systems to address these limitations is possible but comes with its own set of challenges:\n\n* High Cost: Custom development within ERP systems is typically expensive, both in terms of initial development and ongoing maintenance.\n* Time-Consuming Implementation: Developing custom modules or extensions can significantly delay the deployment of critical auto-ID and logistics features.\n* Limited Flexibility and Support: Custom-developed solutions are often rigid, making future adjustments or updates cumbersome and costly.\n\nCleverence stands out by offering solutions specifically designed to enhance auto-ID and logistics operations, seamlessly integrating with existing ERP systems:\n\n* Sophisticated Auto-ID Capabilities: Cleverence provides advanced auto-ID technology support, including a wide range of barcode and RFID solutions, tailored to the unique needs of businesses.\n* Customizable Android Apps: Unlike ERP systems, Cleverence offers customizable Android apps that are cost-effective and designed for easy integration with auto-ID and logistics operations. These apps support both online and offline functionality, ensuring uninterrupted productivity even in environments with limited connectivity.\n* Efficient ERP Integration: Cleverence solutions are built to integrate smoothly with ERP systems, enhancing their capabilities without the need for expensive and time-consuming custom development. This integration ensures that data flows seamlessly between Cleverence apps and the ERP system, providing real-time visibility and control over inventory and assets.\n\nWhile ERP systems are valuable for managing broad business processes, they often require significant customization to meet specific needs in auto-ID and logistics. Cleverence offers a compelling alternative, providing specialized, ready-to-use solutions that integrate seamlessly with ERP systems. \n\n[**Ready Integration for ERP**](https://www.cleverence.com/software/for-a-warehouse/wh15/?utm_source=reddit&utm_term=article_Inventory&Assets_Management_Business_Processes)\n\n# Cleverence vs. Custom Development\n\nCustom development can offer tailored solutions but comes with significant drawbacks compared to Cleverence:\n\n* Custom Dev is Time and Resource Intensive: Custom solutions require significant development time and resources, delaying implementation and increasing costs.\n* Scalability Issues: Custom-developed solutions may not easily scale with business growth, requiring further investment.\n* Integration Challenges: Ensuring seamless integration with existing systems can be more complex and costly with custom solutions.\n\nCleverence provides ready-to-deploy solutions that are scalable, easily integrated, and cost-effective, addressing the primary concerns associated with custom development.\n\nCustom development projects are known for their extensive time and resource requirements. Developing a solution from scratch to meet specific business needs can take months or even years, involving significant investment in terms of both financial resources and manpower. During this development phase, businesses may continue to face inefficiencies in their operations, delaying potential benefits and improvements.\n\nThe business model underlying custom development typically involves selling hours of development work. This approach can lead to escalating costs as projects often exceed initial time and budget estimates. \n\nIn contrast, Cleverence operates on a model of selling device licenses, providing a clear and predictable cost structure. This model allows businesses to scale their operations without the risk of runaway development costs.\n\nOne of the most significant challenges with custom development is achieving seamless integration with existing systems, such as ERP software and hardware devices. Integration is not only technically complex but also represents a major portion of the overall project cost. Many businesses underestimate these costs and the expertise required to maintain integrations over time.\n\nCleverence, on the other hand, offers pre-built integrations with a wide range of ERP systems and auto-ID devices. This ready-to-deploy capability means that businesses can quickly benefit from a fully integrated solution without the additional costs and delays associated with custom development. For well-known ERP systems and devices, Cleverence even offers integration services at no extra cost, recognizing the value of scalability and ease of adoption for its customers.\n\n# How to Sell Cleverence?\n\n# Identifying the Right Customers\n\nThe first step is to segment the customer base according to their current use of auto-ID technologies and their readiness for automation solutions like Cleverence.\u00a0 This is crucial to not\u00a0 expect more than a market can bring. \n\nAn enterprise that would\u00a0 be ready to implement Cleverence:\n\n* Is currently expanding, opening new facilities or recently bought a new business\n* Is growing in amount of orders fulfilled and is overwhelmed with operations\n* Has a dedicated operational manager and time allocated for such projects\n\nHere is the recipe of what to do, depending on how long it will take to close the deal:\n\n* Ready for Upgrade (3-12 months): Companies that are at the right moment in their automation journey, using outdated or inefficient auto-ID systems and facing operational challenges that Cleverence can solve.\u00a0 This is often tied to customer\u2019s expansion into new markets or locations, so there is some budget available.\n\nActions to take: \n\n1. Identify the main pain point\n2. Show a demo on how that pain will be relieved\n3. Educate on licensing and other costs\n4. Prepare a custom proposal\n\n* Aware but Hesitant (1-2 years): Organizations aware of auto-ID benefits but hesitant due to being tied up with other activities, perceived costs, complexity, or priorities.\n\nActions to take: \n\n1. Build general awareness of the solution\n2. Setup reminders or automatic touch points\n\n* Potential Leads (2-5 years): Businesses already exploring or implementing basic auto-ID solutions and looking for more sophisticated, integrated systems.\n\nActions to take: \n\n1. Probably you should skip that opportunity\n\n# Explaining the ROI\n\nThe key point to make is that automation mainly pays out not by cutting jobs or saving time, but by increasing the performance of the capital involved.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/69egw137rsnd1.png?width=2080&format=png&auto=webp&s=68beb64fa9e68a5bf23a163f3da32dc929f90201\n\n",

        "title": "Understanding One-Stage and Two-Stage Receiving in Warehousing and its Impact on Automation",
        "content": "\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8grs8i3dy27d1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbf003e0dcd28413bdf2972d3b89e2f8ad28df65\n\nWarehouse operations depend on the efficiency of their receiving processes. The choice between one-stage and two-stage receiving can greatly influence both efficiency and the automation strategies implemented, affecting the entire supply chain\u2019s responsiveness and accuracy.\n\nChoosing between one-stage and two-stage receiving depends largely on the nature of the inventory and the specific operational needs of a warehouse. While one-stage receiving is efficient for simpler, uniform product flows, two-stage receiving provides the necessary rigor for handling diverse and complex inventories.\n\nIn terms of automation, systems like\u00a0[Cleverence](https://www.cleverence.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_term=17.06_article_receiving_r/warehousing)\u00a0play a pivotal role by bridging the gap between physical warehouse operations and digital backend processes. These advanced systems automate tasks such as scanning received goods, generating quality control tasks, and guiding employees through the putaway process. This ensures accuracy by integrating barcode systems for both items and locations, thus preventing errors and streamlining operations.\n\nAutomation does not necessarily require reflecting each physical movement within the backend ERP system. Instead, the focus is on ensuring the digital documentation like shipping notes and purchase orders are accurately parsed and used to facilitate the physical handling of goods.\n\nBy automating these processes, companies can reduce human error and optimize warehouse operations through precise, guided actions that are informed by real-time data.\n\n\n\n# One-Stage Receiving\n\nOne-stage receiving, or direct putaway, involves receiving goods and moving them directly to their final storage location without interim holding. This process is typically favored when dealing with uniformly packed products, limited range of SKUs or very small receivings.\n\nIn this scenario, warehouse staff consult digital systems to verify stock keeping units (SKUs) and find appropriate storage locations immediately upon goods arrival, optimizing both time and space within the facility.\n\nOne-stage receiving is also particularly advantageous for handling smaller volumes of goods that can fit onto a single cart. This scenario is common in settings like back stores of retail outlets or in trades involving high-value, low-volume items like electronics. In such cases, employees prioritize finding and filling specific storage locations directly from the reception area, maximizing efficiency and reducing the need for extensive sorting or staging.\n\nThen there is a question of what to scan first \u2014 product barcode or location barcode. To scan the location barcode first, an employee should already be in the warehouse looking at that location, and the product should be already carried to that location. That means that location-first scan should presume that it doesn\u2019t really matter what product we carried to the warehouse for binning into the location, because if we care about the product then we have to scan the product first.\n\nFor small receivings\u00a0that can fit on a single cart, the configuration should focus on a location-first approach. In this setup, Cleverence displays the entire list of items along with their preferred storage locations. The system prompts the user to scan the storage location barcode first, filtering the display to show only the items meant for that location. Subsequently, it requests the scanning of item barcodes, ensuring precise placement in designated spots.\n\nFor larger receivings\u00a0where the volume is still manageable in a one-stage process, the configuration shifts to a product-first approach. Here, the process begins by scanning items to be put away. After items are selected, Cleverence guides the user to appropriate locations, displaying where items should be placed and then confirming by requiring a scan of the location. This method ensures efficient handling of larger batches while still maintaining the streamlined efficiency of one-stage receiving.\n\nThis method simplifies the process further by allowing workers to directly transport and store the goods without intermediate steps, making it ideal for swift inventory turnover and limited storage space scenarios.\n\nThis streamlined approach ensures that operations remain agile and responsive, particularly beneficial in retail environments where space and time are at a premium.\n\n\n\n# Two-Stage Receiving\n\nConversely, two-stage receiving involves more complex processes where goods are first unloaded to a temporary staging area. Here, they undergo quality control checks, sorting by SKU or batch, and possibly repackaging. So, in practice it can involve 2,3,4 steps but be still called 2-stage.\n\nThis method is suitable for shipments containing a diverse array of SKUs, mixed batches, or items requiring serial number verification. The initial stage focuses on verifying and sorting goods, while the subsequent stage involves strategically placing these sorted items into their designated storage locations.\n\nSuch a method is beneficial for handling larger or more complex shipments, facilitating meticulous inventory management and minimizing errors during putaway.\n\nIn scenarios involving\u00a0large, diverse receivings requiring complex handling, Cleverence must be configured to handle multiple stages, typically including separate stages for receiving, quality control, and put-away.\n\nThis configuration allows for:\n\n* Receiving:\u00a0Items are initially received and logged.\n* Quality Control (QC):\u00a0Items undergo QC processes where tasks are automatically generated to inspect and sort goods based on quality and specifications.\n* Put-Away:\u00a0Once items pass QC, they are moved to their final storage locations. Depending on the specifics of the inventory (whether entire pallets or mixed boxes), the system can be set to prioritize either product-first or location-first methodologies.\n\nThis ensures that either entire pallets are moved efficiently to single locations or mixed items are distributed across several locations based on space and accessibility.\n\nThis configuration flexibility allows warehouses to adapt the software to meet their unique operational needs, ensuring that the automation not only supports but enhances the efficiency of warehouse operations. Whether handling small single-cart receivings or managing complex, diverse inventories requiring staged processing, Cleverence provides a robust solution that streamlines tasks and reduces errors through smart configuration and guided processes.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x8cxe6h9y27d1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=3426eb2e17f33156fcb9626c083ff676414a8081\n\n# One-Stage vs. Two-Stage Receiving\n\nThe choice between one-stage and two-stage receiving can significantly influence both inventory accuracy and labor costs, affecting the bottom line and operational efficiency of warehouse management.\n\n# The impact on inventory accuracy:\n\n* One-Stage Receiving\n\nIn a one-stage process, goods are directly placed in their final storage location immediately upon receipt.\n\nThis approach minimizes handling and the potential for errors during multiple stages of movement.\n\nHowever, the accuracy of this process heavily depends on the initial receiving checks. If items are not correctly verified against purchase orders and shipping documents at the point of entry, there could be discrepancies that go unnoticed until a later inventory audit.\n\nAutomation tools like barcode scanners and real-time data entry are crucial in enhancing accuracy in this method.\n\n* Two-Stage Receiving\n\nThis method typically involves more checkpoints, such as an initial sorting area where items are inspected, sorted, and sometimes repackaged.\n\nThis additional step allows for a more thorough verification process, potentially catching errors or damages before items are shelved.\n\nWhile it can be more labor-intensive, the increased handling can lead to higher precision in inventory records, as discrepancies can be addressed early in the receiving process.\n\n# The impact on labor costs:\n\n* One-Stage Receiving\n\nGenerally, this method requires fewer touches of the product, which can translate to lower labor costs.\n\nThe direct route from receiving to final placement eliminates the need for intermediate handling, reducing the time and labor required.\n\nThis efficiency makes it particularly advantageous for operations with limited personnel or those seeking to streamline workflows.\n\nHowever, it demands high accuracy in initial receiving practices to avoid costly errors that could require additional labor to resolve later.\n\n* Two-Stage Receiving\n\nAlthough this method may involve higher labor costs due to the increased handling of goods, the division of labor into specialized tasks (receiving, quality control, putaway) can optimize the use of workforce skills and improve overall job performance.\n\nEmployees can become experts in specific stages of the receiving process, potentially reducing errors and increasing throughput.\n\nThe added labor cost could be justified by the reduced risk of inventory inaccuracies and the need for subsequent corrections, which are often more disruptive and costly.\n\nThe decision between one-stage and two-stage receiving should consider the trade-off between potential labor savings and the risk of inventory inaccuracies. Warehouses with high-value items, complex inventory needs, or high volumes may find that the additional labor costs associated with two-stage receiving are offset by the gains in accuracy and reduced need for corrections. Conversely, operations that handle uniform products or have smaller volumes may benefit more from the cost savings and simplicity of one-stage receiving.\n\nIn both scenarios, integrating advanced automation systems can help mitigate the downsides of each method. Systems like\u00a0[Cleverence](https://www.cleverence.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_term=17.06_article_receiving_r/warehousing)\u00a0not only streamline the receiving process but also ensure that data accuracy and labor efficiency are maximized through features like real-time tracking, automated sorting, and guided putaway processes. This technology investment can significantly enhance the impact of the chosen receiving method on inventory accuracy and labor costs.",

        "title": "Choosing the Right Android Barcode Scanner for Odoo Inventory Management",
        "content": "https://preview.redd.it/wci5duu9o70d1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74b92860866144ca4569cc3906f9f9e1d4431dfd\n\n\n\nSelecting the right AutoID hardware, specifically an Android barcode scanner, for use with Odoo Inventory is crucial for the efficiency and accuracy of your warehouse operations. Barcode scanners play an essential role in tracking and managing inventory by quickly capturing product information and integrating it into your Odoo system. This immediate data entry helps maintain up-to-date inventory records, reduces errors associated with manual data entry, and speeds up processes like receiving, shipping, and stocking.\n\nThe environment in which the scanner will be used also affects your choice. For a rugged industrial environment, you need a device that is durable and can withstand drops, dust, and moisture. For retail settings, a lighter and more user-friendly model might be more appropriate.\n\nBattery life is another critical factor. Choose a scanner with a battery life that can last through at least an entire shift to avoid downtime. The scanner's connectivity options are important as well. Ensure it can connect easily with your existing network via Wi-Fi or through a mobile network if used in field operations.\n\nPerformance is key, so consider the scanner's speed and accuracy. A fast, high-accuracy scanner can significantly enhance productivity. Also, think about the ergonomics of the device. It should be comfortable for workers to use, especially if they will be operating it throughout the day.\n\nSelecting the right AutoID hardware, specifically an Android barcode scanner, that will work in your environment is crucial, but it's complicated by the fact that Odoo does not support most hardware natively. Typically, Odoo recommends using pre-configured Zebra devices due to their proven compatibility. However, this limitation can be restrictive depending on your specific needs and environment. Not all scanners will integrate seamlessly, so it's important to choose devices that are known to work well with the Odoo Inventory system.\n\nAn effective alternative for just a Chrome browser is to use third-party software like Cleverence Warehouse 15, which is designed to bridge these compatibility gaps. This software not only supports a wide range of hardware but also enhances functionality with features tailored for warehouse operations. Using Cleverence allows more flexibility in choosing hardware that may be more cost-effective, rugged, or better suited to your specific operational demands than the recommended Zebra scanners.\n\nThe benefits of incorporating Cleverence Warehouse 15 are significant. Firstly, it supports a broader variety of Android barcode scanners and integrates these with Odoo Inventory seamlessly. This integration ensures that data captured on your devices is accurately and efficiently reflected in Odoo, enhancing real-time inventory tracking and management. Furthermore, Cleverence offers smart features like tracking serial and batch numbers and optimizing the storage and retrieval processes. These capabilities make it easier to manage inventory with high precision, from receiving and shipping to handling returns. The software shows where items should be placed in the warehouse or picked from, streamlining operations and reducing time spent on manual tasks.\n\nUsing Cleverence Warehouse 15 not only broadens your hardware options but also boosts operational efficiency, provides flexibility in hardware choice, and enhances the overall functionality of your Odoo Inventory management system. This makes it a compelling choice for businesses looking to optimize their inventory processes beyond what is achievable with standard Odoo support.",

We started about 2.5 years ago with a 10k sqft facility. \n\nOptions I would recommend to get short term leads include:\n1. Get listed as a warehouse on existing directories (like Olimp, crossdockbuddy, transloadnow, and loadmatch)\n2. Find local ports or other similar groups where carriers, forwarders, and brokers that serve your area may be listed. For example for our Tampa warehouse, we went on the Port of Tampa and Port of Manatee directories that publish logistics companies that serve the ports with their phone numbers and emails. We reached out to these folks and now get leads from drayage carriers we meant via this\n3. Run paid Google ads (requires a website). We get most our leads from this and from organic website content that is published so we show up when people search online for transloading, reworking, and other warehousing type work in the Tampa area.\n4. Reach out to local distribution centers and beverage distributors to offer restack and cross dock services. We restack loads for a couple load distribution centers (normally dry and liquid food goods). We also do a lot of beverage restacking, and there seems to be many beverage distributors in each region and liquid loads are likely to shift.\n 5. Try to get on the internal warehouse lists of larger freight brokers like TQL, Nolan Transport Group, Echo, and similar large companies. The only way we have had luck with this is by a sales rep Googling for a restack warehouse then we do the job and later followup to see if they have any other projects we can help with. \n\nI hope these ideas are helpful. Feel free to DM to discuss more.",

        "content": "I feel like I can change these to improve my DC performance but I'm really stuck now.\n\nBasically I'm working for a 3PL company, we don't manufacture, we only receive/pick up parcels and deliver, so our inventory velocity (supposed) to be really high, due to our geographical location, the DC where I'm working receive tons of both transit and picked-up parcels (which need to be sorted according to destination) everyday.\n\nProblem: According to data, outbound performance which is based on on-time dispatching (inbound parcels those were received less than 30mins to the nearest dispatch time according to schedule supposed to be all out) is still low, (80-90%).\n\nReason: There are many reasons that I got stuck to solve, one of those is missing parcels and slow unloading/loading. As 3pl company, our parcels shape are really diversified, we currently contain them in woven bags, as it water-proof and avoid stealing as we know when someone trying to tear the bag (with carton box they can tape the cut line), and for some reasons, the company has tried carton box but they have changed back to bags, I'm new here so not really aware of the biggest reason, but if anyone can point out the biggest advantage using box over bags, I will try to dive deeper into this.\n\nSo, using bag leads to handling problems as bags are not 'flat' as boxes, using pallets and lift them with forklift trucks don't seem the best? We are using 100% human, operators grab bags which are piled as a mess inside the truck, throw out, place them as the other messes on the ground (because there are different destinations so we gotta stack them up in different piles near each other), so here comes the impact: many parcels are damaged (due to being thrown, ofc or this loading gotta take ages to finish) and parcels probably get messed up between different destionation piles, bringing those pile farther to eachother might lead to longer loading time later.\n\nI'm consider of not placing parcels on ground **at all** that I'm gonna make them load all those parcels down to mobile carts. I found one looks pretty feasible, Idk how i got its pic and what its called but I want to hear your opinion on this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/maymvah5ipf51.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=70565df04c60ff9a0baabae78e588779ef78ac90\n\nSo those container above are like a trailer that is attached to eachother which can serve a wide range of parcels or bags' shapes. But the amount of parcels/bag are really high, I'm not sure if these are good for storing them when unloading from a truck. Also, this only helps moving them quickly within the warehouse, it doesn't help the loading, unloading part, and we can't really stack them really high on those so we can't really utilize the capacity.\n\nThe size of those piles of transit parcels also different, those going to small warehouse probably just take 2 to 3m2, those going to big warehouse/DC might take up to 5 to 10m2. We got a gravity conveyor for operators to let them slip to floor but they refuse to take it as u know, grabbing each and throw them directly is much quicker, unless parcels already grouped into big/small baskets within the truck and their job is just to scan barcode of the basket which got data of number of parcels and then let it slip through the conveyor to floor (not sure if the conveyor and handle the big basket), but managing the flow of the basket through the entire warehouse network accross the country is complicated too... so I'm so stuck here.\n\nSorry for my long posts, but there are so many problems and aspects that we gotta improve. Look forward to hear your experienced thoughts. Thanks.",

And assume you'll get another ASN then they ship the rest. Then they send you an X12 invoice for payment (810) and then when you get the other 25 you send the payment, reference the EDI invoice.\n\nThen there's a ton of other EDI docs that convey things like, order changes, acknowledgements, cancellations, inventory positions, sell-through data etc..\n\nIf you want to go this route, let me know,.. if you PM me, I contacts at organizations that do nothing but setup retailers with traditional EDI, and we do enough volume that a referral will probably get you into the pipe faster.\nYou would probably be fine with an EDI portal that does all the mapping in the background and just gives you the results in a webpage, or a file and then you could do some local scriping (in excel or a local script) to move the portal A to your systems B&C. Or for a little more $$ just have them incorporate your systems formats into the portal.\n\nAt that point you just tell your vendors you use the following  X12 documents (810, 850, 856 etc..) and/or a phone number to the portal programming dept.\nAt that point you push your standard and it's your vendors/suppliers and it's their job to comply\n(at least that's how it works for the big-box retailers)",

We then make our one labels for internal use.\n\nThere are two major errors we face, vendor errors and internal. Secondary errors are product that is tagged/upc'd incorrectly and mixed cases. \n\nWe allow a 100% overage before the system rejects the shipment. 99% of the time we just issue a new PO for the overage. This makes it hard to catch mistakes until after the fact. We end up with a fair amount of PODs from vendors since most of the time the overage is an error that caused a shortage.\n\nWhen a case is identified as being an error it is sent back to a problem area for investigation. (If we follow our SOP) sometimes this does not occur and it is simply reshelved. There is no reporting process on this activity in place at this time. Which causes inventory accuracy issues. Manual adjustments are then carried out to correct these when discovered which.. causes more inventory issues. \n\nOur main software package is JDA combined with homebrew WMS. \n\n I'm interested in comparing our process with others. \n\n* How do you receive product?\n* How do you handle an overage/shortage?\n* What do you to correct your inventory?\n* How do you handle reshelving in your forward pick. (if you have one)\n* Do you cross-dock?\n* How many warehouses do you operate?\n* What software do you use?\n* Do you use 3PLs for receiving? In-house or off-site?",

There's a few was to approach this, but you're likely going to need some level or OMS for order import to a centralized system from your different sales channels (Wordpress's Woo, eBay, Amazon, Point of Sale etc). This will help organize customer info, inventory info and a few other things. The software I've worked with are MOM, Stone Edge, and Netsuite. My favorite bang for the buck was Stone Edge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPart 2 is the WMS or fulfillment side of things. at $2m a year you've got a respectable number of packages going out a day most likely. I've worked with QSSI's Powerhouse (Absolutely solid for the price), High Jump (not so great web-based interface) and Manhattan's Scale which is comprehensive, but can get pricey. The features I'd look for to minimize shrink or lost items are as follows:\n\n1. Receiving against purchase orders\n2. Put away module (from receiving locations to racks/ bins). It's helpful when you can configure business rules to make it predictable where your products are going\n3. Pick/ Pack/ Ship module. A good starting point would be a paper pick ticket system which is pretty standard and easy to train on. the concept is send a picker out with a cart and ticket, and have them bring it to a packer who validates the correct items are picked prior to shipping.\n\nThe OMS and WMS might not be the same software suite, so check to see who's software integrates with others nicely. Some of the listed software about will likely be able to be a good stepping stone as a singular solution until your business scales even further. Good luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

        "content": "Hi Reddit,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this is a good place for this post, as its my first reddit post. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would greatly appreciate any advice that can be given that could improve inventory accuracy for the company I just started at. I was previously in warehouse distribution managing a much larger, but much less chaotic, inventory. I recently started working for a small business that does custom A/V installations. Here is a breakdown of the elements I believe to be factors relevant to managing the inventory for this company:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- We are using QuickBooks: Premier Retail Edition as our only way of tracking inventory(not inventory software)\n\n\\- There is a main warehouse where the majority of our product for installs is stored. All product is received in at this location\n\n\\- There are 5 fully stocked installer vehicles that our installers keep filled with inventory and use product on jobs as needed. When installers use inventory on their trucks, they let the owner of the company know via email (or at least they're supposed to)\n\n\\- Jobs for customers are billed to the customers periodically, when certain portions of a job are completed. In other words, when goods leave the warehouse, that does not mean they leave inventory in quickbooks at that time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n TLDR:\n\nNo inventory management software with 6 places that inventory items can be at any given time (not including job sites that have goods at them that have not been billed yet). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs my solution as simple as it seems? Just get inventory management software? If so, what ones can you recommend for the above circumstances? Its also worth mentioning that this company is growing rapidly and I expect in the next 2 years to have twice as many installers and installer vehicles or more, and a second warehouse location. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks so much for any advice in advance.",

Most will let you set containers or locations and let you scan inventory between them via barcoding. So you have inventory in warehouse. Someone with a installer truck requests some parts and you scan it from the WH to the truck. When they sell it off the truck you show it as shipped/sold/etc.. and check it out of inventory.\n\nThis way you know who has what where (and can tie it back to trending/metrics/shrink calculations etc.. etc..)\n\nThere's a lot of software out there to handle this type of stuff, but I always suggest looking at what you'll need for the long term when building a WMS solution. What volumes will you have and what functionality do you think you'll need in 2-5 years. (and of course the biggie for everyone what's your budget)\n\nWe've worked with everything from freeware to $1M+ systems and everything in between and what I suggest to everyone is to look at your processes for a week or so, talk to all the key players and come up with:\n\nYour list of core requirements. \nA list of wish/want/nice to have, might need in 3 years, bells and whistles. \nFigure out if you have any other systems or processes you will want to hook into.\nand \nDecide on your budget. \n\nThat will give you a much better window of available solutions and then you can sort through the short list to determine what packages are best for you.",

Best i can tell, the main difference is the WMS handles inventory from Put away through order fulfillment.  WCS does not handle inventory management, just the life of the product from Order waving through completion (plus replenishment).  The cost is also a major difference but the ROI will come with labor reduction.  Just not sure if a WMS, even at a lesser cost, can create the same efficiency as a WCS.",

I'm looking for help in trying to find inventory management software that is easy to use when the products we sell come in many different options / permutations.\n\nFor example, one wig, from one brand, from one manufacturer, can come in 140+ different colors. A particular manufacturer has over 250 wig styles of which all can be ordered in 140+ colors. This equates to about 35,000+ SKUs that we, a very small wig shop, need to keep track of, all from only ONE manufacturer. Of which we have about 10 manufacturers we work with on a weekly to monthly basis.\n\nI've looked at many options for setting up, this or that, system, as well as cloud based, bar code readers, etc. But all of them sound too similar, and don't advocate a large inventory  / catalogs with large permutations. Any help will greatly be appreciated.\n\nEDIT:\nThank you all for your suggestions.

This store mainly deals in wholesale goods that are made to order but I'd like to find a way to improve my sales in terms of stock that I have on hand. \n\nMy product is a niche clothing line that is sold on a B2B level. Something like uniforms. \n\n**The Front End** \nBasically the items I sell could be broken up into the following categories; and this how it should look to my customers when they go \n\n**Made to order items(MTO)** that are ordered from our manufacturer for supply to our customers\n\n**Ready for Sale (RFS)** Stock we have available for immediate sale. \n\n**Clearance (CLE)** Stock on Hand that has been marked down due to the style being discontinued.  \n\nSo the way these three interact with each other is that MTO and SOH can be combined for a single order, but CLE items need to be distinguished because they can no longer be made to order. \n\n**The Back End**\nI won't even try to explain how I control my inventory on hand vs inventory on transit at the moment. It's a mess and the sooner I can put it behind me the better.  Due to the fact that I want to have two streams of transaction (sale of stock on hand vs. order of made to order product) but I want to have everything under the one stream, I have devised several different non-exclusive statuses, they consist of the following.  \n\n**SOH - Stock on hand**   Items in stock ready for immediate sale \n\n**SOO - Stock on order**  Stock on order for delivery within lead time \n\n**SOR - Stock on reserve**  Stock on order that has been allocated to an order\n\n**BSI  - Balance of Sellable Items**   Basically SOH + SOO minus SOR\n\nHow am I doing?

Our (small) office here in London has a storage room with quite a collection of items currently being auctioned or about to. \n\nAs I'll be in charge of streamlining our future auctions I am considering reorganising the storage room. Indeed I spent way too much time last week looking for an item in particular simply because nothing is labeled or stored in a relevant way. \n\nI would like the inventoring of this to be visible on a screen so I can share the inventory status with other teams. At first I thought about a very simple Google spreadsheet and a daily update I'd do by the end of the day but I would love to find something slightly more professional with the opportunity to scale up alongside business growth. What I'm looking for is dead simple really: what got in, what' the status of what we have in (auctioned, waiting for auction, auction completed / needs to be shipped) and a clear identification of all items, nothing more really.\n\nI hope this makes sense, if any of you have any suggestion that would be absolutely splendid. \n\nThanks a lot",

Input - when new items come in they're received. \nWhen you receive you print a item label and depending on how much you want to spend, have directed putaway \"put this item in aisle b row 2\" Or \"cabinet b, shelf 2\" Or if your volume is low enough you could scan the item barcode, then the barcode of the location as you put it away wherever you want.  (obviously this means you need to barcode your locations as well, be it shelves or aisles or buildings.)\n\nB. Storage - At the end of either process you have Item (with all it's details that you entered, size, price, photo etc.. whatever you want) and you have it's location.\n\nC. Output - On sale, you pick/ship the item (even it that's just pulling it from inventory and handing it to someone who just bought it) \n\nAt this point you can show (most WMS's have a portal) what inventory is where and how much of it there is.\n\nIn addition, you now have lifecycle historicals on these objects and can do fun Business Intelligence stuff with that data in the future. (How long do watches normally take to auction off, what item gets damaged in storage the most, what is the average storage time/space that's not billed for etc.. etc..etc..)\n\nDepending on your budget, there are systems that can do all of this, and a ton more. but I'm assuming you're looking for something in the lower end.\nI suggest you build a list of options you want/need and browse this list:\n[List of major WMS systems](http://www.capterra.com/inventory-management-software/)\n\nThis is a pretty extensive list, but I'd suggest Fishbowl, Delivrd, inflow, and Zenventory based on first blush.\n\nAlso, I've worked with people at auction houses before. One suggestion I have is to make sure you get removable labels and/or string tags with barcodes if you're tracking them. (don't cause item damage on add/removal, customers appreciate that)",

                "body": "So, i'm going to guess that you're an online retailer.\n\nFirst thing is to amend your routing guide to insist full upc barcode compliance so that 15% disappears at someone else's cost. \n\nI've found in apparel, the concept of item velocity analysis for directed put away and replenishment is almost impossible to utilize. Fashion moves and changes, you're typically only seeing a style once a season and that's it. Unfortunately in our environment, you're going to have to deal with tons of re-warehousing for sku consolidation. \n\nIn one of our buildings, we obtain inbound production quantities by ETA. (in your case you could push buyers to advise their planned purchases.) We then take a conservative educated guess on what a given sku's capacity on a GOH bar based on body type, and pre-slot locations. If it's flat pack, we're not preslotting as our bulk picks are from pallet racking, and then we down pick in a downpick area. \n\nAfter we've slotted locations, when we receive that style throughout the season, users are directed where to put away, so it's forced consolidation. Returns are directed to those locations, and in the event something is incorrectly located (not scanned) we can almost always find it right away based on where we initially told the associate to locate to.\n\nOnce a month we run location utilization reports. Then issue re-warehouseing (relocating and consolidation) to consolidate locations. Where one style at height of season could have been 1500 units each size, taking up 5 GOH bars, now can be consolidated to 1/4th a bar.  \n\nI have no idea what system you're on, but directed put away is great for us. We can pre-slot locations based on any factor: vendor, style, color, size, receipt, etc. By using directed putaway, you can have a uniformed warehouse layout by one planner deciding where everything goes. We also scan piece by piece on the inbound, like a supermarket scan, and scan piece by piece on the outbound at packing. Our inventory was 99.98% accurate last year. ",

        "title": "How to Choose Your Inventory Management Software",
        "content": "You\u2019ve either noticed that your operations are starting to suffer due to lack of organization or data accountability or you just need to find a better solution for managing your inventory. Choosing a software that fits best with your business needs and making the switch isn\u2019t something to be taken lightly. So how do you find and choose the best software? How can you even be sure if something is the best? It\u2019s important to remember that software is subjective and what may work for one business may not work for someone else.\n\n**Analyze and identify your needs.**\n\nBefore you even start looking at inventory management software, the first thing you need to do is look at your workflow and identify your current challenges. What do your day to day operations look like? Do they resemble how you imagined them or do you need a complete overhaul?\n\n**How\u2019s your productivity now?** Are your employees taking a long time tracking down inventory, either physically in the warehouse or by combing through spreadsheets? As time is being spent attempting to execute a task, productivity is being lost. Your employees aren\u2019t able to get their job done!\n\n**What are you spending on your current inventory management solution? What are you losing due to deficiencies in it?** If you\u2019re already using an inventory management system that is costing you more money than it is saving you, it\u2019s probably time to reassess your situation. If you don\u2019t have an inventory management system and you\u2019ve had stock sitting just sitting too long on the shelf, or have been unable to keep popular items within your demand needs, you are losing money.\n\n**What\u2019s your track record for order and fulfillment accuracy?** Obviously, the end goal is something close to a 100% accuracy rate when managing your inventory and fulfillment process. But many businesses have a hard time achieving anything near that, especially if they aren\u2019t equipped with the right tools.  If you are relying on Excel spreadsheets, you are at risk for easy errors by simply hitting the wrong key or accidentally altering a formula. A great way to increase your accuracy when managing stock is by using barcode scanning. By having barcodes for each item, you can simply scan and automatically update your inventory levels without the risk of typos.\n\n*Don\u2019t pick up an app just to have something new \u2013 figure out what you need from a tool, then research for an app that fits those needs.\nWhat to look for in your inventory software.*\n\n**Industry compatible.** Every industry has different needs when it comes to managing their inventory, and lots of software providers have created industry-specific inventory management apps. E-commerce businesses are going to need a software with access to integrations and connectivity to their online shopping carts, while 3PL fulfillment companies will need to keep their clients\u2019 inventory well organized with the ability to have a client portal. Start your search for an inventory management system with your business industry in mind.\n\n**Compatible hardware.** Some older software requires installation and IT maintenance. The reason cloud-based software is becoming the norm is that it offers security, automatic updates, and the luxury of working on any operating system with a connection to the internet. And when you look at your operations you may realize that you need a barcode scanner, a label printer, or even a mobile application. Inventory management systems like Zenventory feature rugged hardware solutions that are certified and tested with our software to ensure that it is the best solution for your business operations.\n\n**Easy data importing and exporting.** When you make the switch to a new inventory management system, you are going to have to transfer your existing data into the new program. If you are upgrading from Excel, simply import your .CSV files straight into Zenventory. You don\u2019t have to worry about painstakingly adding each item manually. Plus, you can export your inventory and more into .CSV and PDF files for easy reporting.\n\n**Ability to grow.** Small businesses who are looking for a new inventory management system don\u2019t have unlimited funds or time to pour into an entirely new software solution as the business grows. Flexible pricing plans with expanding features are usually the best option. If you don\u2019t need the entire set of features that is offered right away, you can start off with a basic plan and add more capability as your company grows. Find inventory management software that meets your current needs and budget, but also has the flexibility to grow with you.  Zenventory is a solution designed for businesses from small to large.\n\n***Ask for help.***\n\nWhen you\u2019re getting started with a new software, you\u2019re going to have questions. So ask! Just like your company, software developers want to make their products work well for you. So don\u2019t be afraid to suggest features, either. Zenventory guides development based on customer feedback and has a rapid product development cycle that allows for flexibility. Plus, you never know: the software might be able to do what you need, and you simply haven\u2019t discovered the feature yet. Asking for help can be the key to successfully implementing your new system.\n\n*Companies want you to love their software, so ask for help when getting started.*\n\n*Also, don\u2019t worry about defaults \u2013 customize apps to fit the way you work.\nIntegrate everything.*\n\nThe best way to maximize the value of your tools is to get them all working together. Minimize unnecessary work and focus on building your business by automating updates, cutting down on copying and pasting information, and smoothly integrating your online marketplaces, shipping, and accounting solutions together into a central system. Get more done, faster, by controlling your inventory across multiple shopping and shipping platforms with Zenventory.\n\n***Evaluate the people, not just the product.***\n\nWhen you\u2019re looking for a cloud-based software, you are building a relationship. Take a look at the company and the people who are building and running the software and give it as much attention as you are giving to the software itself. It\u2019s important to be comfortable working with a company and product that you will be able to grow with.\n\n**Choosing the right software vendor is really about forming a partnership with your solution provider. Here are a few things to think about:**\n\n**Flexible contract terms:** SaaS contract terms should be flexible and fair for both the provider and the client. Watch out for organizations that try to include long term commitments, cancellation fees, or extra charges for updates. Those are signs that they are trying to lock you into their solution. If a solution no longer works for your business, you should be able to ask the vendor to make some changes, or have the freedom to find a new product. [Moskowitz]\n\n*[Zenventory](https://zenventory.com) has no contracts and no obligations. Pay month-to-month or annually and cancel at any time. And ask us about trying it for free!*\n\n**Domain expertise:** Of course every software vendor will have experience in the industry they develop a product for, but there is a difference between understanding how to build software and having true domain experience. True domain experience can usually be spotted in a vendor\u2019s story about how they got started. If all the principles at the vendor lived and breathed the industry their product serves before starting their software company, there is a good chance they have broad domain experience. Their experience will translate into product designs that do a better job supporting your business, and can become a competitive advantage for you. [Moskowitz]\n\n*Ubiquia is a software development company that also produces products like SqBx Package Tracking and SqBx Asset Tracking, along with [Zenventory](https://zenventory.com) for inventory management. With thousands of customers all over the world, Ubiquia knows all about managing stock, keeping track of your packages, and providing top-notch cloud-based software for all of our users.*\n\n**Post-sale support:** One of the most important aspects of choosing the right software provider is the support you will receive after the sale. Oftentimes a provider\u2019s ability to support you is the difference between a failed and successful implementation. Make sure the provider includes full support in their subscription fees. Before selecting a vendor, try their support out. Look for a support team that knows the product, knows the market, and can understand what you\u2019re telling them about your business. Ask whether support is provided by full time employees or less knowledgeable, contracted, or offshore resources. Try giving them a call or sending them an email to see how quickly and thoroughly they respond. [Moskowitz]\n\n*[Zenventory](https://zenventory.com) is owned and operated right here in the USA. With our servers locally based and our headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, you can be sure that you won\u2019t be transferred to a third party call center, but to a friendly support member at our home office. Zenventory also has a help site with insightful articles and walk-thru videos to help all users 24/7 with any common questions.*\n\n*Sources: https://zapier.com/blog/best-business-software*",

I work for a company that produces apparel in China, and is looking to ship primarily to North American and European customers directly. If we're able to ship from China for a reasonable rate, we can get our product to consumers weeks sooner than if we shipped and used a N.A based 3PL service. \n\n  \nIn case it helps, our products are roughly \\~USD200 and  projected costs to ship around N.A. are  \\~15-20USD. Obviously willing to pay a premium if we ship directly, but I haven't been able to find any services to get a quote.   \n\n\nThanks! ",

        "content": "I've not went too deep into research, but there are a couple basic things that I know: There is a shortage of truck drivers, the truck driving industry relies mainly on men age 45+ with many of them being older than 55 and retiring in the next 10 or so years, and there are technology geeks working on making autonomous trucking a reality. \n\nMy guess is that this will negatively affect a broker's salary because with less drivers, they will have less competition among other drivers and be able to charge more. And once autonomous trucking becomes a thing, brokers will be phased out. I don't expect that to happen overnight or even in the next 10 years but maybe 20. I'm new in this business and I don't know much, any knowledge and insight as to whether this is a good career to get into for the long-term would be appreciated. My definition of a good career is to make a lot of money. I already know I don't hate the work, it is work. Work is work.",

Of those 500,000+ carriers, 90% of those own less than 6 trucks. These carriers don\u2019t have the massive cash flow to throw around on experimental vehicles or the timeline to R&D autonomous vehicles. They\u2019re overwhelmingly unsophisticated small businesses that rely on thin margins and moderately volatile market forces to get by.\n\nOf course, 10-20 years from now seems like such a long time to try to forecast, this industry is so fast paced that keeping up with day to day challenges will already keep you busy.",

I have a total work experience of almost 2 years in supply chain. I started my experience as a logistics coordinator for a 4pl company, worked on Excel and ERP. Switched to a manufacturing company(my current job) as an operations analyst, working for the Finance department, but the role is finance operations support role. I have learned multiple skills within this year, running cost analysis report for work orders,for parts ( both stock and special CO), also for labour report, doing inventory analysis, and also working with Production to run weekly schedule orders for special parts, my team sort of does material planning for SKU as well. Also update the cost of parts on ERP based on burden and labor and providing quotes to sales sometimes when my superior is on leave.\n\nNow, I have narrowed down my options to 2 from here. Either progress in the supply chain (which on operational end I believe won't make much of a difference, as salaries are saturated). The second one is finance or accounting. I do not exactly know what I can pursue in the future. \n\nPS : My sole motivation is adequate compensation, so I am looking to shape my career accordingly. Also, another issue is that I have an engineering background. After that, I did a PG diploma in Business Analytics, so I'm not sure how doing any kind masters will work out!",

        "title": "Recent Acceptance of an Offer of Employment for a Purchasing Assistant Role with a major supply chain company in Texas. ",
        "content": "I have been applying for work all year. I would like to say that I am a jack of all trades and a Master of none but I would be lying. I'll start by saying that I have exceptional skills in my interviews. I write my resumes tailored specificly for each role and then write cover letters for the roles to which I've been applying for. I recently had two separate interviews for two similar roles, one being Business Administrator for a highly successful custom chemical group that specializes in selling a range of services related to supply chain management, working within the Gulf Coast refinery industry and other various projects. I had a phone interview and I did very well in the preliminary screening. The VP of the company asked me what my expectations of compensation would be and I stated $25 an hour because of my experience, the most recent salary based jobs that I have had paid this amount hourly. However, the job site is about an hour away from my home. I drive a 2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee and it's not that great on gas. Anyway, I ended up declining the invitation for the in person interview because I was given an offer from another company that is located closer to my home. This position title is Purchasing Assistant for a highly successful and renowned food services company that specializes specifically in sourcing, processing and selling rice. I stumbled upon this opportunity by applying through a staffing agency in the Houston area. Prior to my in person interview, I was asked about my expectations of compensation for this position and I stated that I would expect at the very least $20 an hour but I failed to ask for $25 an hour. That is my current rate of pay as a freelance Executive Administrative Assistant for an engineer who is the Maintenance Supervisor of another very large refinery company in my area. Anyway, when I had my in person interview for the company... I was interviewed by 5 different people who are the leaders of different departments. I was told that although my official title will be Purchasing Assistant, that they will be cross-training me to work across all of the departments within Purchasing. This includes the HR departmen, FICO & Accounting department, Purchasing department, Procurement department, Assisting with the logistics operations and that they need someone who can work for each department in the event of someone taking a vacation or out of the office. I did really well with the interview process and was given a verbal offer. I am familiar with SAP FICO, SAP 4HANA, Excel and inventory management softwares. In the past I worked as an Office Manager & Executive Administrative Assistant for a small business called Savage Technical Solutions. I did not lie about anything on my resume. However, I will definitely need to take some crash courses to essentially be a refreshing task. I have not worked with SAP in a long time. I also have not used Excel in a long time. I am super anxious about this because they would like for me to begin work on Wednesday of this following week. This company is a highly successful, well known, offers exceptional benefits to their employees and a salary based job.  I am making this post because I would like to seek out advice from anyone who has worked as a Purchasing Assistant. I will have to be very proficient in using SAP FICO, SAP MM, SAP 4HANA, SAP FIORY and also have an advanced understanding of Excel and to learn their specific systems that are tailored to the company. The schedule is either going to be 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. or 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The job site is located at the Port of Freeport, TX. Currently I am completing the site safety specific training online. It is 10 hours of training. I will be working through the staffing agency for a probationary period that doesn't have a set time for the role. Once the lead departments decide that they would like to hire me directly and I am also on board to work for this company, I will then sign a contract directly with the company. I feel that I should renegotiate my compensation package due to the responsibilities of this role being that I will be working in several different departments to be essentially a \"floater\" for the Purchasing Department of the company. How should I approach and draft a proposal for the renegotiation of compensation? I feel that the rate of pay ($20) an hour is not enough for the duties and responsibilities of my title being a cross-functional position. I believe that $25 an hour is a reasonable pay, considering the complexity of the role that I have been hired for. I would like to add that I am currently enrolled as a part time student in Business Management with two minors, Human Resources and Accouting. I have a prior Associate Degree in Health Information Technology with a minor in general psychology. Anyway, I would greatly appreciate any advice by others who have worked or are currently working as a Purchasing Assistant within supply chain management. Any tips or anything related to the responsibilities of this role. This is an incredible opportunity for me and I really want to succeed and to be prepared for work on Wednesday. I am a tad bit anxious about the role because I do not have an advanced understanding of Excel or SAP FICO. I am asking for some advice on how to find a free or inexpensive crash course on these two softwares. ",

        "title": "I have 3 jobs, and I'm still underworked. ",
        "content": "Using a throwaway and I'm avoiding any specifics for obvious reasons. I am a small business owner. I run a 3PL logistics company (Company A) which I founded about 15 years ago. About 5 years ago now, I realised I was no longer getting any satisfaction at work. Even though I was making decent money, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was stuck in a dead end job. My wife, who has a comfortable and high paying corporate job, tells me about her day every night and I found myself envious of all her stories. And so, after many sleepless nights, and a year of contemplation, I ultimately decided to go on a job hunt, in an effort to seek some joy from my career life. I transfered the shares of my company to my 2 brothers who work for me, and a few other staff, and slowly started shifting all my responsibilities throughout my team. \n\nAfter 3 months of job seeking, I was approached by an MNC 4PL company (Company B). This is a company which is instantly recognised by anyone in the industry, and I was offered the role to be their Director of Operations, which more than doubled my already above average earnings. I accepted the job the second they offered it to me, and started a couple of months after. I soon learnt that this new role afforded me luxuries that were completely foreign to me. I had a very high performing team with several managers reporting to me, each managing a team of between 10 to 15 people. Everyone seems to be great at what they do, and they operate like a well oiled machine. My tasks were limited to just responding to 5-10 emails a day (mostly forwarding emails from my VP to my team), and attending 2-3 online meetings a week. On top of that, despite operating out of a pretty large facility (5 story office block attached to a huge distribution centre) most of the office employees at Company B worked from home. There have been times where I have worked from home for 3 weeks straight without stepping foot in the office, with zero repercussions (my VP and MD operates from the regional HQ in a neighbouring country). And everytime I'm in the office, it has never been more than 10% full, and the only time I ever saw everyone together at the same time, was at our company retreat which I bailed after a day because I got bored. I am holding the most senior position at the company in my country, so I got away with it pretty easily. \n\nInevitably, after 2 years or so in this role, the itch to find something more substantial arose yet again. This time, I got in touch with a few headhunters which I've used at Company A, to explore the possibility of yet another change. Due to how little I was doing at Company B, I felt a little insecure about my job, and felt I wasn't learning anything. In less than a week, I had the first of three interviews at Company C, an MNC electronics manufacturer, for the role of Head of Supply Chain. The role was mine 5 minutes after the 3rd interview ended. I spent a few nights contemplating this new opportunity. Company C was offering a 25% pay bump over Company B, but it was going to be a regular 9 to 5 with no possibility to work from home (I checked). But given my freedom at Company B, I soon devised a plan to accept the offer from Company C without resigning from my position at Company B. \n\nThe guilt and fear of being caught lasted about 2 months. Since then I've developed a system on how to juggle my roles. I report to work everyday at Company B at 8.00am everyday without fail. I try my best to greet everyone I see, and have as much physical interaction with everyone, never forgetting to drop by HR to greet whoever I see a \"good morning\" (our HR department has the highest attendance by far). I leave at 8.45am (people leave the office throughout the day to meet clients and vendors so there's nothing suspicious here) and arrive at Company C at 9.20am. I clock in and get to work. Our department has half a floor to ourselves, and I have my own corner office so joining meetings and calls for Company B can be done with privacy. Overall, I definitely have more to do at Company C, but even then, it only occupies 40% of my working hours. I manage a much smaller team here. About 12 people across 3 teams, but if anything, they bother me less than my teams at Company C. There isn't really much for me to do at Company C. My job is to essentially manage our order processes, our 3PLs performance, and our deliveries to our distributors (about 30 distributors throughout the country). Coming from a 3PL and 4PL background, this came relatively easy. It took me about a week to create a performance report template which my teams fill on a day to day basis, which I present to my Operations Director and MD at the beginning of every month. I've also delegated most meetings with our vendors to my team (I justified it to my management as my way of training my team to take up more responsibilities and building a succession line). I do occasionally meet with my vendors, but that only occurs about once a month at most. I chair our weekly department meeting every Monday at 10am (so I'm never left in the dark about my teams' issues and performance). I leave Company C's office at 5pm sharp (my managing director at Company C is pretty flexible on working hours especially for the senior staff) and head back to Company B to catch those who are leaving the office at 5.30pm. Most times, I don't even take my laptop out of the bag. I just walk in, grab a glass of water, and chat with whoever I see. I then leave at 6.15pm and head to Company A where I'm still employed as a \"Consultant\" to sign some cheques and invoices. I leave Company A at 7.30pm and I'm home for dinner no later than 8pm. \n\n3 streams of incomes, never more than 50% occupied throughout the day, and constantly worried about getting found out. This however is coming to an end as Company B has been pushing me to accept a Regional Senior VP role which will require me to move to the company's regional head office in a neighbouring country, where they don't work from home. I'll most likely tender my resignation at Company B if I can't talk my way out of that role. As for Company C, my direct boss (Operations Director) is a guy in his early 60s. I'd love his job, but there's some competition for it, not to mention he's not showing any signs of retirement. And lastly, as for Company A, business could be better but I'm less hands on these days. My brothers are doing their best, and I trust their judgement completely. At our last brothers meeting, we made the decision to sell of the company if the right offer comes along so we're currently working towards that. I know these 3 incomes won't last forever, but it has been one hell of a ride. ",

        "content": "**What does 3PL mean?**\n\n3PL is an abbreviation for Third-Party Logistics.\n\n# What is 3PL?\n\n3PL is outsourcing a variety of general eCommerce processes. Some of those processes include warehousing, fulfillment/distribution, and inventory management.\n\n# How to use a 3PL?\n\nThird-party logistics centers can be used in a variety of ways for eCommerce businesses. Generally, you'll ship your products directly to a 3PL and they will input your goods into their warehouse management system (WMS) for you to ship your products where they need to go.\n\n# How to set up with a 3PL?\n\nYou'll initially want to list out the various ways you plan to use the 3PL. If you're an eCommerce Seller, that may include FBA prep, FBA forwarding, storage, or multi-channel fulfillment. Once you've set up what you need your 3PL to manage, could you start reaching out to them and let them know your requirements and ask for their pricing?\n\n# How to choose a 3PL provider?\n\nWhen you are sourcing a fulfillment partner you'll want to consider your supply chain. For example:\n\n* Where will your products be coming from?\n* Will they be palletized?\n* Are they hazardous goods?\n* How many packages will you be shipping out per day?\n\nWhen you gather all of your supply chain details, you'll want to find a partner who can help minimize costs and have strong relationships with shipping carriers to transport your goods. For example, if you plan to fulfill multi-channel, then you'll want to make sure you check their partnered shipping rates for a few of your key items and ask about their shipping lead times.\n\n# Is 3PL right for your business?\n\nIf you're looking to outsource distribution and fulfillment, then 3PLs can play a key role in helping you grow your online business. They empower you to sell through multiple sales channels and store your inventory safely.\n\nIt's vital to conduct a cost analysis and measure their reliability to deliver on all promises they make.\n\n# [Need a 3PL?](https://valetseller.com/fulfillment/)",

The good news is, we've recently secured some initial funding and seen a lot of interest in this product!  Here's what it's all about:  \n\n\n**Some initial features:**\n\n* **Centralized dashboard for live order tracking:** Know exactly where your orders are at all times, so you can make faster decisions and avoid overstock and cash flow issues.\n* **\ufe0fCentralized Dashboard for Seamless communication:** Streamline communication between you and your suppliers, eliminating endless email chains and finger-pointing as well as meetings and excel spreadsheet updates\n* **E-sign approvals:** Get rid of those paper trails and expedite approvals to keep your supply chain moving.\n* **Accurate reporting:** Gain the insights you need to optimize your inventory management and make data-driven decisions.\n* **Multi-tier visibility:** See everything that's happening across your entire supply chain, from raw materials to finished products.  \n\n**Would a solution like this make your life easier?**   If so, I'd love to hear about what excites you most about these features in the comments below and what concerns you would have as a retailer or supplier!  \n\n\n**P.S.** I am personally not trying to sell you - we would love genuine feedback and conversation!

However, your target audience will be mid to large enterprises that are mature enough to have their ERP and also work with suppliers who also run on an ERP system. Most brands aur retailers in the western hemisphere and have their suppliers overseas in Asia. The suppliers in Asia may or may not be on a ERP or any sort of software system. Even if they are, they may most likely be running on some local system. These are some of the practical challenges. This has been tried before but never became a large enough business. \n\nHowever, if you identify a good niche/intersection of trade where the multiple trade partners operate on an ERP system that can potentially be integrated, then this idea certainly has legs.",

        "content": "I've been searching for inventory management software that goes beyond just partial order fulfillment and incorporates priority-based order allocation along with customer segmentation. While I've come across solutions that assist in partially fulfilling orders by splitting quantities, I'm seeking a more robust tool that can handle scenarios where the combined orders exceed available stock quantities.\n\nIdeally, I envision a software feature where upon creating shipments for these orders, a notification would alert me if the available stock cannot fully satisfy the selected orders. From there, the software would provide a pop-up interface allowing me to allocate available quantities to each order based on prioritization criteria.\n\nThe prioritization criteria I'm looking to implement are based on customer history and interactions with our business. For instance, I'd prefer to allocate larger quantities to fulfill orders from longstanding customers or those with a positive payment history, while potentially allocating fewer quantities to newer or riskier customers.\n\nIn essence, I'm seeking a tool that allows me to manually determine the distribution of available quantities to each order based on factors such as customer loyalty, payment history, and other relevant metrics. If anyone knows of software solutions or tools that offer this functionality or something similar within the realm of inventory management, I'd greatly appreciate any recommendations or insights.

Some parts of this are intentionally vague, but feel free to ask for clarity if you think it would help produce higher quality responses, and I'll do what I can. \n\nI would like to build a strong supply chain career, and I would also like to lead people. One of my current goals is to become a regional supply chain manger for a global company. I'm a little stuck based on my current resume, as to this point my resume been built based on monetary needs more than a chosen line of work or career path.\n\nI currently work in Logistics for a global manufacturing company on their North American supply chain team. My background in Logistics is pretty strong, going on 8 years, the majority of that with 3PLs on the service provider side of the industry. I've moved all modes of domestic and international freight and have some warehouse/inventory management experience as well. I want to grow in supply chain, but I feel stuck in Logistics. I also would like to move into management, but do not have much experience with leadership, or direct reports.\n\nIn my current role, I primarily support outbound export shipments, but also support inbound shipments and assist with our FTZ team managing inventory and shipments in/out of the FTZ. My role interacts with the regional supply chain team and material buyer/planners. \n\nMy company is going through a tremendous transition right now, and this has caused the turnover of the majority of the supply chain team, including upper management (think regional manager level). I really liked my current manager (he is no longer ith the company), he was very supportive of personal career growth.\n\nGiven this transition at my current company, I reached out to a prior contact to inquire about an Operations Supervisor position for an LTL trucking company. That conversation went well, and he has an opening. I'm currently interviewing and am expecting an offer. Based on initial conversations, it will be a paycut from what I'm currently making, which I'm hesitant about, but, I believe I'm in a financial situation to absorb the potential hit.\n\nWould I be better seved making the jump to Supervisor for an LTL trucking company, or trying to bridge my current companies transition into a move from logistics into a greater supply chain role into buying/planning/quality etc?\n\nAs an add on, has anyone ever moved from LTL ops supervisor to ops manager, and then over into a regional/global supply chain manager role (which as noted has been one of my career goals)? Or is the LTL world too specific to move from it over into a regional/global supply chain manager role in manufacturing?\n\nIf you read this far, thank you for your time! If you leave a comment, I would be very grateful. Thank you!",

        "content": " \n\nHello everyone,\n\nI'm currently exploring ways to deepen my understanding of supply chain management and to increase my credibility within the industry. I've been working in a logistics-related role for a few years now, and I'm keen on taking my career to the next level. Given the vast array of certifications, I'm finding it a bit overwhelming to determine which would be most beneficial for someone in my position.\n\nI'm particularly interested in certifications that provide a strong foundational understanding of supply chain principles and cover advanced topics like digital transformation, sustainability, and global supply chain strategies. My goal is to gain a broader and deeper understanding of the industry, stay updated with the latest trends, and ultimately enhance my professional standing.\n\nI've come across several certifications like APICS CPIM (Certified in Production and Inventory Management), CSCP (Certified Supply Chain Professional), and SCPro (Supply Chain Professional) from CSCMP, among others. Each offers unique benefits and focuses on different aspects of supply chain management.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from anyone who has taken these or any other supply chain certifications. Your insights on the following would be incredibly helpful:\n\n1. **Your personal experience with the certification process**: How challenging was it? How much time did you dedicate to studying?\n2. **How did it impact your career**? Did it open new job opportunities? How did it affect your professional credibility and your understanding of the industry?\n3. **I'm looking for someone with a few years of experience in logistics. Based on my background, which certification do you think?**I'm looking for someone with a few years of experience in logistics: Based on my background, which certification do you think.\n4. **Resources for preparation**: Are there specific books, courses, or other materials you found invaluable?\n\nI'm also curious if there are emerging certifications that focus on integrating technology in supply chain management, as I believe this will be crucial in the coming years.\n\nThank you in advance for sharing your experiences and advice. Your input will be invaluable in helping me navigate my career path in the supply chain industry.",

        "content": "So I have been doing some thinking on this, and want to hear your thoughts. It is rather obvious that EV\u2019s will not be the long term winning solution to power our vehicles. The batteries do not have a long life (~10 years) and are expensive to replace, grids cannot support charging stations, and the natural resources to produce them are only going to be harder and more expensive to get. It will be much more likely that hydrogen takes over once they are deemed feasible, safe, and operational for consumers to buy and drive etc. \n\nSo why are we giving tax benefits and this plethora of other perks for those that purchase these EV\u2019s?? \n\nThis originally upset me as I work in supply chain and most in my industry will also tell you it just doesn\u2019t make sense to have EV long haul vehicles (semi\u2019s etc.) due to the nature of them in their current state. The batteries are heavy thus reducing the weight you can load (=less efficient supply chain/more loads), the infrastructure is not there to support charging fleets, and the batteries do not last as long as a diesel. So why do we still see Tesla and these other companies gaining so heavily?? Elon Musk??\n\nWell all of these thoughts have lead me to this conclusion. This is in connection to the fears of Saudi becoming way too wealthy and powerful, and also buying up quite a bit of US products such as WWE, LIV golf and competing with us. Saudi makes most money from oil, which is not required for EV\u2019s. Are EV\u2019s being pushed simply to pump the brakes on Saudi wealth as we will buy less barrels of oil from them due to increase in US usage of EV\u2019s??\n\n Elon is a big player with the govt and also playing a massive part in national security in relation to his operations with satellites. Through that relationship, is he now bigger picture and getting more support from the US on the EV front so we do not continue giving our money to Saudi? Just earlier today I see they are finally losing money, and it sparked these thoughts. Let me know what you guys think!\n\nEV\u2019s = short term solution pushed by govt with global agenda while we work on better sustainable energy options - very smart ",

An overwhelming 98% of executives now acknowledge AI as a crucial element in reshaping the industry, marking a significant shift towards digitalization and innovation in logistics and supply management.\n\nThe adoption of AI technologies is not just a trend but a strategic imperative. These advancements are set to redefine the traditional paradigms of supply chain operations, offering unprecedented levels of efficiency, accuracy, and speed. By integrating AI, companies can leverage predictive analytics to forecast demand more accurately, optimize inventory levels, and enhance route planning. This not only reduces operational costs but also minimizes waste and improves customer satisfaction by ensuring timely deliveries.\n\nFurthermore, AI's role in supply chain management extends to improving transparency and resilience. In an era where disruptions have become the norm\u2014be it due to geopolitical tensions, pandemics, or climate change\u2014AI provides the tools necessary for businesses to anticipate challenges, adapt to changes swiftly, and maintain continuity in the face of uncertainties. Through real-time data analysis and machine learning algorithms, AI enables companies to identify potential supply chain bottlenecks before they escalate, ensuring a more agile and responsive operation.\n\nMoreover, the environmental impact of supply chain operations is a growing concern. Here, AI offers solutions to promote sustainability by optimizing routes to reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions, and by facilitating the transition to greener alternatives. This alignment with environmental goals not only benefits the planet but also enhances brand reputation and complies with increasing regulatory demands for sustainability.\n\nThe consensus among executives, as highlighted by DP World, underscores a transformative phase in global trade and logistics. AI's integration into supply chains represents a leap towards a more interconnected, efficient, and sustainable future. As technology continues to evolve, the potential for AI to further revolutionize these critical networks is limitless, promising a new era of innovation and growth for businesses worldwide.",

Some people evaluate inventory cost as just the value of the products stored in your inventory. However, it is much more than that. Your inventory cost can be calculated by including all the following expenses \u2013\n\n* Value of purchased products in inventory\n* Taxes on stored products\n* Taxes while purchasing\n* Cost of labour and staffing\n* Security costs\n* Insurance costs\n* Value of obsolescent products\n* Transportation and handling costs\n* Storage cost, which includes the rentals, electricity bills (especially in case of temperature-controlled places), etc.\n\nIf you are worried that your inventory costs are growing and you feel the need to control them, here are some smart ways by which you can keep your inventory costs in check:\n\n* Avoid suppliers that impose minimum order quantities.\n* Know when to restock, avoid restocking before reaching that point.\n* Optimize space allocation for your stock.\n* Get rid of outdated products as soon as possible, even if that means selling them on a low margin.\n* Follow Lean Manufacturing.\n* Optimize your workflows and reduce waiting times for sold products.\n* Implement Inventory Management Software. \n\nFollowing these tips can help you to lower down your inventory costs significantly and focus on your business to grow better.",

        "content": "One of the biggest challenges for brands with multiple sales channels is managing the orders.\n\nA lot of things need to be kept in sync to start a business. These things include inventory management, product details, order fulfilment, shipping & logistics, and more.\n\nThis challenge is acknowledged by retailers across the world and is resolved using e-commerce multichannel management software.\n\n**Reasons to Use Multichannel Ecommerce Software -**\n\n**Centralize Tasks**\n\nInstead of replicating the same tasks for every channel, the software will centralize things in a single place. Once all the tracks are connected, a product or service can be added to all the selected channels in one go.\n\nMoreover, the product description remains the same across all the channels. Whenever there is any optimization, it is executed everywhere.\n\n**Expansion in Market**\n\nThe use of the software will help retailers avoid repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus on improving customer experience, finding new customers, looking for new opportunities, and further expanding the market. By efficiently using software, one can easily reach customers all around the country and globally.\n\n**Collect Insightful Data**\n\nWithout the software, the data remains irrelevant as it is challenging to be analyzed. eCommerce multichannel software can analyze data for all channels and provide valuable insights about customers, orders, sales, etc.\n\nThe date can be used to build profiles of the target customers, their order history, time zones, delivery areas, interests, devices used for shopping, etc. This data can be smartly used to attract more customers for more orders and drive sales.\n\nData analysis holds a lot of potential and can help create profitable sales and marketing strategies.\n\n**Sales & Support**\n\nThe multichannel retailing software increases customer loyalty and sales by making order management seamless and improving availability across all platforms. With the software, retailers can reply to customers on various platforms while keeping the inventory sales, queries, and reviews in the correct order.\n\n**Manage Vendors**\n\nFrom the dashboard, the retailers or company owners can easily manage all the products and vendors. Information about the vendors (bio, photo, product niche, etc.) can be added/edited, and priorities can be set for each vendor based on locations, pricing, and product availability.\n\nMultichannel retailing is an excellent approach, but one must do it strategically to avoid the challenges.\n\nThe use of multichannel eCommerce software like Unicommerce makes the processes smooth and efficient. There are several other software benefits, like building customer loyalty, improving brand reach, and offering an immersive customer experience.",

        "content": "Well-managed inventory management is critical to any business. With it, it's possible to stop a series of problems that poorly done inventory control can cause. Here are a few of the most important benefits of a good Inventory Management Strategy -\n\n**A more organized and practical stock**\n\nWhen implementing the process of inventory management, the primary step is to stay organized and keep everything in an organized manner. And once the practices are in place, the facilities are huge. An organized stock makes the customer service process and ordering more smooth and easy and reduces the overall time.\n\n**Higher accuracy on products available**\n\nA well-organized stock also allows you to simply know which items are sold maximum, allowing you to form a balance, keeping only the essentials. This makes products not be missed without you having to spend an excessive amount of space to keep an outsized inventory that doesn't have such a lot of output.\n\n**Helping customer maintenance and bringing new customers**\n\nWith good stock management, it'll be much easier to satisfy customers\u2019 demands quickly. This way, they're going to have greater chances of trying to explore the services offered by your company for a replacement purchase, by becoming loyal.\n\nThis ability to satisfy orders quickly also can help usher in new customers through mouth publicity, as satisfied customers will mention your business to their contacts, and attract more buyers by making recommendations.\n\n**Time-saving**\n\nGood stock management will help your business or brand stop wasting much time! With optimized, computerized, accurate, and arranged inventory, you'll not need to waste time making multiple and long controls to form sure everything is on track. This control is going to be much simpler and automatic.\n\n**Waste of cash reduction**\n\nWould you wish to scale back costs? With well-optimized and organized stock, this gets much easier. The well-managed management makes it possible to understand the dynamics of the stock well so that money isn't wasted with products that have a slow exit.\n\n**Increased efficiency and productivity**\n\nThe use of technologies that allow good stock management, like Universal Product Code reading machines and control and organization software, greatly contributes to increasing the efficiency of your business and, consequently, productivity.",

        "content": "**Some Ways to Reduce eCommerce Order Fulfillment Time are -**\n\n**1. Select the right order fulfilment solution**\n\nIf you want to reduce your eCommerce order fulfilment time and employee costs, you need to use the right order fulfilment model for your business.\n\nA smart integration will not only save you time and money but will also help in eliminating human errors and mistakes.\n\n**2. Third-party fulfilment partner (3PL)**\n\nIf you are not equipped enough to effectively fulfil your eCommerce orders within your company, you may need to seek the help of third-party fulfilment partners or logistics company (3PL).\n\nOne of the main advantages of this solution is that you won\u2019t need to invest in order fulfilment software, buy or rent warehouse spaces, interface with shipping carrier\u2019s platforms, hire warehouse staff, and more.\n\nEvery third-party logistics company is different. Before choosing one, you need to have a clear idea of your overall budget, business needs and wants, and your business's growth plan to choose the right 3PL company that best suits your business.\n\n**3. Dropshipping**\n\nIn the instances where you do not stock specific goods and/or you are not the manufacturer of the goods you sell online, you may choose the option to drop ship your orders.\n\nIn these cases, you fully rely on the product manufacturers to create, store and ship their products directly to your customers.\n\n**4. Leverage integration solutions**\n\nTo quickly fulfil orders, you need good visibility in various areas of your business \u2014 logistics, sales, and inventory to name a few. Having easy access to all your data at any time, and in real-time is key to your business success.\n\nHowever, as we have seen above, to meet current customer\u2019s expectations and to fulfil their orders, you need to implement various platforms like a Website, Inventory control system, Shopping cart, Warehouse management system, CRM, Accounting system, etc.\n\n**5. Understanding your cost per order**\n\nIncreased fulfilment time usually results in increased fulfilment costs.\n\nIncreased order fulfilment time is directly linked to the fact that various systems are not connected and hence, you spend a lot of time, inputting the same data, reviewing it, and comparing the data on different screens of various applications over and over again.\n\n**6. Reduce the impact of order returns**\n\nAllowing customers to easily return their purchases is an absolute necessity in today\u2019s highly-competitive marketplace. It helps in improving client engagement and is perceived as a customer-centric retailer or brand.\n\nThough, it also has a negative impact as getting a lot of return packages can be a nightmare for any company as they result in increased operational costs without generating any income.",

The problem at which I am stuck is\nCase1:  Let's say we are doing a demand forecast for each store than we can directly sum up these demands and add them for our inventory which we need to order for our DC, and if incase we open another DC than we can simply divide this demand based on our Store-DC mapping.(Am right assuming this thing or will there be any other complications?)\n\nCase2 : Here we are adding all the stores historical data      at DC level and then do the forecast at DC level, and if we open another DC than we can do similarly.\n\nSo how will the result vary in both the cases, what are the complications and which one is the better approach?\n\nAny help is appreciated and thanks in advance.

With so much happening in logistics and the global economy, we wanted to explore how consumer preferences around sustainability are influencing the last-mile delivery space.\n\n* **57% of consumers** are interested in sustainable home delivery options.\n* A staggering **99%** are open to doing more to reduce their carbon footprint.\n* **89%** said economic pressures, like inflation, affect whether they can afford to pay extra for eco-friendly delivery.\n* **37%** now weigh **convenience** and **sustainability** equally when choosing delivery options.\n\nOne notable trend is the rise of **green delivery slots**, where multiple orders are bundled into fewer trips to cut emissions and reduce costs. **56%** of respondents are ready to adopt this practice. For last-mile providers, this could be a key innovation to not only help the environment but also manage operational costs more effectively.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take? How is the last-mile space adapting to meet sustainability goals while dealing with cost constraints?

        "content": "I wanted to share my experience in the logistics field, hoping it might help those considering this career path. I've worked on both the 3PL/freight brokerage side and the customer side, and it's been quite a ride.\n\nWorking as an account coordinator at a 3PL is intense. The volume of emails and last-minute issues is overwhelming. While larger 3PLs offer some work-life balance with specific departments handling after-hours issues, smaller brokerages expect you to be available almost 24/7. I made around $64K, but the constant stress and off-hours calls were exhausting.\n\nBeing a logistics specialist on the customer side is less stressful. I've worked for smaller companies, and the volume was manageable. I rarely had to stay late or deal with off-hours issues. However, the pay was lower, around $45-$55K. While it's a more relaxed role, it doesn\u2019t come close to the $100K salary range I'm aiming for without moving into a scarce managerial position.\n\nI\u2019ve also tried customs clearance, which is similar to domestic logistics with constant updates and issues. The financial rewards aren\u2019t much better.\n\nOverall, logistics is a tough, undervalued industry, and the pay reflects that. It's challenging to find a role that pays well without demanding excessive hours. For those considering this field, be aware of the demanding nature and limited financial upside.\n\n",

        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI work for a mid-size property management company in the NE US.  We have a warehouse that we have built at our new office property, and we hold all inventory for the maintenance and HVAC teams within this warehouse.  This includes appliances for unit upgrades and turns.  We have no inventory management system, except a person with a spreadsheet but no way to track who is taking what, or where it ends up.  I'd like to implement a QR based system that would allow for items to be scanned when removed from the warehouse (showing who is taking it, and that it is no longer part of 'warehouse inventory'), then scanned when installed at the appropriate property (adding to the property 'in-use inventory').  I'd like each of our maintenace team members to have individual access to this system so that inventory is tied to the person.  I'd like to be able to generate inventory reports that will inform our purchasing agent what we need.  \n\nI'm not sure if QR is the best path forward, but it's what we've come up with in a brainstorming session.  I imagine something like this, or close to this at the very least, exists already, but I'm not finding anything that isn't related to retail inventory management, or if it is maintenance focused is filled with work order management and other features we don't need because they're covered in our PMS.  Anywhere you good people can point me is appreciated!\n\n  \nThanks",

Then you can easily view a report of equipment by location. \n\nWhether you use QR or barcodes doesn't really matter. You need to ensure that your inventory is tracked when it comes into the warehouse, and that whoever decides which equipment shall go to which job enters a ticket of some sort -- whether its a transfer or a sale.",

And it handles media like an Ecom software should, but that doesn\u2019t work for my team.\n\nWe require quick access to products, and photos of the listing based on the DBA that owns it.\n\nExample: client calls about a product, requests photos and details of it. It takes so long for to find in Shopify, without knowing the SKU, and downloading the photos in general is tough, on mobile is impossible.\n\nWhat we need is a system that more natively handles media, and makes it easy to manage that data. We considered using a CMS like straps, content full, payload, etc, managing all of it there, and just importing into Shopify with a sync.\n\nAnyone have any ideas? Let me know if you need more details. I\u2019d be willing to pay $ for a more in depth conversation about a real implementation solution. But need to hear thoughts first",

Right now, the page feels bloated.\n\n**A bit of context**:  \nThe page allows users to edit items in our inventory, including fields like:\n\n* **Item**\u00a0\\- Item name, description, and purchase price\n* **Supplier(s)**\u00a0\\- Supplier details (dropdown of suppliers and supplier items)\n* **Location(s)**\u00a0\\- Location its inventoried in (drtopdown of locations)\n\nAny general advice on reducing component \u201cbloat\u201d in Blazor, collapse, tabs, examples, etc?",

We operate a **Kava and Kratom bar** with a fairly complex menu, and I was hoping to connect with someone experienced in both MarketMan and Toast to see if I could pick your brain.\n\nHere\u2019s the challenge I\u2019m facing:\n\nEach drink we offer allows for the base to be **customized** with various options:\n\n* **Kava:** Solomon, Fijian, Tongan, Vanuatu\n* **Elixir or Kratom (Powder Variants):** Red, Green, Yellow, White\n* **Elixir Premium (Strained Leaf Variants):** Red, Green, Yellow, White\n* **Lucky 8:** A blend of all four colors in one batch\n\nWe also offer **different sizes** (16oz and 24oz), which creates **multiple inventory variations**. The system generates **different GUIDs** for these variations, which complicates recipe tracking.\n\nOn top of that, we have **multiple menus** with different pricing strategies. For example:\n\n* **Raspberry Lemonade (GUID 12345):** Main menu item pulled from the POS\n* **Raspberry Lemonade 16oz (GUID 12345-xx):** Higher-priced menu version\n* **Raspberry Lemonade 16oz (GUID 12345-xy):** Standard-priced version\n\nAdditionally, guests can add **extra syrups or creamers**, and I need the system to track those modifiers accurately within the recipes.\n\nHas anyone faced similar challenges? If so, I\u2019d love to know how you managed these kinds of **complex recipe variations and modifiers** across MarketMan and Toast. Any tips, insights, or best practices would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

So I don't necessarily do inventory management in what I'd consider the normal sense, I'm a graduate supervisor for a woodshop in my department at college. We have lots of battery powered hand tools as you'd imagine, and we allow checking them out and keep track of who takes a tool but there's no real inventory system so it's easy risk of losing or having batteries stolen and if anyone knows tools, DeWalt power tools and batteries aren't cheap. It's not necessarily a problem but it's something my shop manager would like if we could find something intuitive and relatively simple.\n\nAt a previous university he worked for they did it the simple way, serial numbers and sharpie on an inventory number. But it's a lot of upkeep and figuring out if something gets rubbed off, what numbers have/haven't been used, and he said it just took more time than it was worth. \n\nSo we're trying to figure out if there's any sort of small scale options with QR or barcodes to track tools with. It could just be app based with using our phones to scan, that's probably the easiest if that's a thing. I appreciate any advice or ideas to look into!",

Right now we use a combination of Google Sheets, Quickbooks, and BlueTrace (a shellfish specific traceability app)\nOur needs are slightly unique as a shellfish operation, and furthermore because we distribute product grown on our own farm as well as product that we purchase from other farms locally. \nOut biggest pain point right now is we double enter all of our sales orders (technically triple enter because 2 people are entering them) and we want to make this more efficient. \nOur biggest needs are:\n\u2022 Ability to create a lot code for every harvest \n\n\u2022 Software that will print this lot code on our shellfish tags along with harvest date and location, as well as name of customer to whom we\u2019re shipping \n\n\u2022 Ability to generate this information on the tags based on sales orders and lot selection which is entered during sales order entry phase, rather than having to enter it a second time to generate the tags \n\n\u2022 Inventory tracking based on what we harvest (this could be considered what we \u201cproduce\u201d as a raw material from a manufacturing standpoint)\n\n\u2022 Ability to Aggregate our sales orders for the day into a list of what we will wash and pack into bags for shipment from what has been harvested \n\n\u2022Ability to sort/filter these aggregate lists by date, brand, shipping route, customer to produce our various pack out and shipping lists\n\n\u2022 The ability to create purchase orders\n\n\u2022 Quickbooks integration \n\n\u2022 Ability to generate Bills of Lading (we ship all over the US and Canada) \n\n\u2022 Need to generate reports weekly and monthly to the regulatory overseers based on time/date/temperature of harvests, of products received from other farms, and based on shipments and order fulfillment so we can prove we are being safe and trace it back if someone gets sick from shellfish. \n\nAny ideas or experiences are appreciated. \nOur revenue is over 1M per year and we have a stated goal of 20% growth next year. This inventory software issue is a block to that growth right now. \nWe have looked at Acctivate and Food Connex (from CAiSoft) but are hesitant to pull the trigger until we feel certain it will work for us. \nThanks!\n",

Your operation sounds really interesting, and I can see how managing such complex processes with your current tools can be a major bottleneck, especially with your goal of 20% growth.\n\n\n\nSince you\u2019re dealing with both farm-produced and externally-sourced shellfish, it\u2019s essential to have a system that not only simplifies order entry but also tracks inventory in real-time with full traceability. Your specific needs around lot code generation, sales order aggregation, and regulatory compliance make it clear that you need software built for complex workflows.\n\n\n\nHave you considered exploring systems that incorporate AI or machine learning for optimizing inventory tracking, lot management, and reporting? Some companies in the food and agriculture industries are turning to AI-driven solutions for automating manual data entry and improving traceability. These tools can even aggregate and analyze harvest and sales data, helping you make quicker and more accurate business decisions while keeping everything fully compliant with regulatory bodies.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve seen companies in similar spaces reduce manual entry and streamline operations by using more integrated solutions\u2014this might help you eliminate that triple entry problem and improve overall efficiency. If you\u2019d like, I could share some specific examples of how AI is being used in traceability and logistics, and how it could benefit shellfish operations like yours.\n\n\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on this or explore options if you\u2019re interested. Feel free to DM me for more info, and I\u2019d be happy to share ideas and insights tailored to your needs!",

I'd suggest this is at the front as it's going to be a massive timesaver to know where to head to begin with. \n\nFrom here I'd be looking at the next step once the worker gets to the right floor - where should they look next to quickly locate the part? If you have any other ways you can split up each room then this would be my next code to add in - could be color coding, or \"ikea style\" row and aisle or you might have category areas that you can lean on here.\n\nI'd try to keep the code as small as possible, but still contain all your key \"way finders\" above. It's essential you make them all consistent so that workers can learn how to decode them.\n\nOnce you have your code structure down, then you should start looking into how to label and track each part on the shelf - again, hundreds of possible options available here, but [this blog post here on bin locations has a couple of options](https://craftybase.com/blog/bin-location) (including using QR codes for simple scanning on mobile phones etc.)",

I've found that even though the overarching principles of inventory management are very simliar in many situations generally speaking, there are a lot of businesses that have unique requirements that just aren't covered by OTS systems that also usually come with a huge price tags. This is where I can help.  \n  \nIf you like, I'll be happy to discuss your requirements and work out exactly what you need. I have also made arrangements to suit some of my clients so that instead of paying me a large lump sum fee for the system I build for them, they use it pretty much as a SaaS so that they can use it for as long as they want, and I look after all maintenance and all future upgrades (that they request) at no extra cost to them.\n\nHappy to show you examples if that helps too, so feel free to get in touch via DM.",

We also have inventory spread across 3 warehouses and each warehouse has their own method of giving us inventory data. If anyone has any recommendations I would really appreciate it.",

It supports multi-warehouse management, real-time inventory tracking, and advanced SKU management, making it a strong contender for your needs.\n* **TradeGecko (now QuickBooks Commerce)**: This platform is well-suited for businesses that need to manage multiple SKUs across various warehouses.

I just had an idea of how to potentially streamline our warehouse inventory and looking for any kind of feedback. \n\nAs of now we use ServiceTian for our go to software for everything (inventory, estimates, sales, client communication). For everything outside of ServiceTian, we use pen and paper to tell our warehouse manager what additional parts we are stocking on our vans and he will do paper inventory of all warehouse inventory every so often\n\nI'm thinking of a program to replace the pen and paper, using barcodes > google form > Excel.\n\nI want the tech be able to take a picture of a QR code that will take them to a google form where they have a list [part 1.2.3.) ect] and they can take a picture of the barcode of the part that they are taking. That information with be sent to an excel file that can keep count of all additional inventory on top of ServiceTian. \n\nIs this a dumb idea that overcomplicates things, or is this a good idea that potentially has been done before? \n\nWould appreciate good and bad criticism along with technical terms and any additional ideas. \n\nAppreciate any and all help. Willing to trade any HVAC help / advice as payment. ",

Otherwise you are syncing 2 databases.\n\nYou mention QR codes; they might be more than you need. A QR code is good to represent very long text strings such as URLs. A barcode is easier to generate. \n\nI would use a scanner rather than a phone. They are quicker to use. A 2d (2 dimension) scanner can scan barcodes and QR codes into the spreadsheet \n\nA QR code can take them to a website that has the inventory list in it (eg a google or shared excel sheet). The user can then  see how many parts there are (eg part123) and scan out ones he/she is taking. \n\nI think you would only want a QR code to point to the inventory list of there are lots of spreadsheets to choose from. I assume there would be only one inventory list in a know website location  \n\nIf you just want to replace the pen and paper with excel or google, that is easy. You can scan items into, and out of, the spreadsheet and have the sheet broadcast to many people so they can see a live copy \n\nAn example is in the link below (the sheet can be in excel or google, and the excel can be shared so everyone can see it, like a google sheet)\n\n[https://www.improvingyoursmallbusiness.com/inventory/](https://www.improvingyoursmallbusiness.com/inventory/)\n\nI would think through first the need for data to flow between ServiceTian and the warehouse inventory. If no need, then yes, you can create a warehouse spreadsheet. \n\nFeel free to post questions.",

                "body": "A QR code is a quick and easy way of redirecting users to a website where the rest of the functionality you're after can happen. It eliminates the need to remember urls, and can also be used to direct the user to the exact place on your website they need to access, to record what they need to. A solution like this can be added on to your existing website or hosted separately, with any kind of authentication required.  \n  \nAs part of the initial set up, when someone scans the QR for the first time, they can be asked to enter their details in a form that will record who they are and make the process a lot easier for them at any subsequent login by recording their credentials in local storage so that the system recognises them the next time they need to use it.  \n  \nOnce they arrive at the correct url, they will then be able to scan barcodes corresponding to whatever parts they're picking on their phones, which is the least expensive option given that everyone has a phone, which is stored in a database together with the details of the user, and time and date.  \n  \nThis data can then be downloaded as a csv for further use, manipulation and analysis by date range or any other criteria you wish. If you really want to use Google Sheets instead of a downloadable csv, then that can also be easily achieved by integration with Google Sheets.\n\nThe other thing you need to remember is the bit where you need to create the barcodes and assign them to individual parts.\n\nBased on this overview, I think you're idea is solid.

        "content": "I\u2019m a small business owner managing inventory on my own and I do not enjoy this work nor do I want to do it. We have 2 retail brick and motor locations rons selling snacks, candy, drinks, cookies, etc. we have about 500+ SKUS and are currently using Shopify for our POS and inventory management. \n\nI\u2019m not a fan of Shopify for retail so we are considering switching to KORONA POS which is built for convenience store applications. They have a much better inventory management system where I can also input expiration dates for products. \n\nHere\u2019s my question - I want to hire someone to do all inventory management for my business. This will include the following:\n\n1. Inventory analysis  - what\u2019s selling what\u2019s not. What location needs certain products. What are our A B C products, how much we should stock or a certain product etc. \n2. Inventory ordering for all location. Placing weekly orders with our vendors \n3. Working with retail employees to Receive  inventory in to POS and confirming all products are received and inputted. \n4. Vendor relationship to an extent I\u2019d still be involved somewhat in this. \n\n\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s other task they\u2019ll need to do but this is essentially what I need. This is my first time looking for someone who can do this. What job role should I hire for? Inventory manager, inventory specialist? What\u2019s a typical salary for this role? Can I get away with someone who is entry level and can learn or need someone with 1-2 heads experience? \n\nAny advice is appreciated. \n\nThanks ",

In our warehouse we use a simple bin system where the picking workorder has Qty, Sku, Product Name and warehouse bin number.  We can search our inventory by sku or bin number.  Every product also has a product code which is our internal database number.  This number never changes so we can change sku, bin #s or barcodes w/o affecting all the other info associated with the internal product code like product name, inventory level, stock on order, historical sales, vendors, cost, pricing, descriptions, SEO data, etc.\n\nWe do use a 3PL for some items that are barcoded but barcodes definitely do not need to be the same as the sku number.  If you want them to be fine, but that is simply personal preference and won't really affect most inventory systems.  At our 3PL we have multiple mfg bar codes mapped a single sku for a number of products that have more than one source.  The 3PL software easily handles this, we simply enter all possible mfg barcodes for a given sku.\n\nThe most important number IMHO is to have a static database number.  All the stuff around and linked to this number like barcode numbers can change, even the sku or product name, but you need to have a fixed database number for a product that the system can point everything to that should be related to that product.",

The sites share all resources, so I'm hoping for a way to differentiate what each site has while also seeing the total amounts for both sites combined so we know what we need to order. \n\nI tried using Sortly because excel makes me want to die, but management said I have to stick with a microsoft product since we already subscribe to them. From what I've seen, Microsoft doesn't have a specific inventory management program. We've been using a crappy homemade Excel sheet, so I'm hoping for a template or something to make the process easier.\n\nI just need the sheet to track item name, description, and what we have on hand, as well as having a section for receiving items. Then I want it to automatically generate how many we need to purchase based on a preset minimum level. It would also be helpful if I could include images of the items. We don't use any sort of item number or price because the lady who does purchasing just orders whatever's cheapest from wherever she feels like it.\n\nI know I could probably just create this page myself, but I'm all out of brainpower for this project and I'm really hoping for something premade that I can just edit slightly then start plugging numbers.

While the initial investment might be higher than traditional barcode systems, the long-term savings in labor costs, time, and loss prevention often outweigh the upfront costs. I came across GAO RFID Inc., which offers solutions you might find useful for implementing this technology.",

I would prefer that it integrates with Quickbooks Desktop in Canada.\n\nNeed to have various types and sizes of product and also a way to only use a portion of a sheet of steel for a project and put the remaining back into inventory. This may be a more manual process though.  Also need to track material test reports to each applicable order.  Need fields for type of metal (alum, stainless, etc.), type of product (sheet, rod, tube) and dimensions.\n\nDon't need it for job costing at this time, just inventory tracking and creating purchase orders, that then link to vendor invoices in Quickbooks.\n\nAny help is appreciated.",

I\u2019m new to inventory management and as a medium sized property management company, am struggling to come up with a solution for our supplies. \n\nLong story short, we have an office space and warehouse in the back with mostly LVP flooring, glue, self leveler, used appliances, HVAC, pipes and other odds and ends. We are starting to keep parts in house for our turn over and maintenance teams but are having problems coming up with a way of organizing them in the AppFolio software we use. \n\nVendors and techs can come and go mostly with ease grabbing what they need and texting myself or leaving a note on my desk. I\u2019ll check inventory weekly to make sure the count is the same, often times it is not. I\u2019ll have vendors text saying they need X boxes of floor so I\u2019ll bill out that amount, only to find out they took half, and now need the other half that isn\u2019t there.\n\nObviously we need a new system and I\u2019m trying to wrap my head around it. I\u2019ve thought of a paper organizing system where they can sign out what they took, to where, why etc\u2026 but what\u2019s stopping anyone from saying they took 10 but really grabbing 12? There are no cameras back there.\n\nThank you",

        "content": "I work for a small brick and mortar + online retail business, and we order products from different businesses all the time. When we receive their products, I call or email them requesting a spreadsheet containing the barcode numbers, style numbers, color and size (if necessary), title, description, pictures if available, stuff like that. \n\nI imagine I can\u2019t be the first retailer requesting such information from a wholesaler. So many people are listing products online these days, or use inventory management systems and need this information. \n\nI see it all the time when I go from one website to another when shopping for something; the same description and title are on both websites. Clearly the wholesaler sends these companies the same title and description to best represent their product, along with photos, etc. \n\nBut why is that whenever I contact a company, the representative acts as though I\u2019m the first person to ever request such a thing, needs me to be transferred to 4 different departments, and MAYBE someone can find the \u201cdownload as .xlsx or .csv\u201d button for the items in my order. \n\nWhat gives? Is there a better way this is done in the retail / wholesale industry and it\u2019s going right over my head?? I can\u2019t imagine retailers like Walmart are sitting there manually copying and pasting the description and title for a Play Doh product from Playdoh. com\u2019s retail site or whatever each time they are adding a new item to their database. \n\nNow, I\u2019m no Walmart, I get that, and I once heard something about EDI systems that automate restocking inventory when you\u2019re a Target or Walmart sized company. \n\nBut I feel like I don\u2019t need an EDI system for my small business to get a spreadsheet so I can import product data into my system. \n\nAs of now I\u2019m resorting to manually entering 90% of this information, and manually typing up style numbers when I don\u2019t have a digital invoice, or copying and pasting style numbers and product names one at a time from a digital invoice, then scanning the item\u2019s barcode when it arrives through the front door to get the barcode info for that specific product. \n\nEvery company has a different way of operating, and it\u2019s near impossible to keep track of how each company does what. Some offer an updated Dropbox link containing a master product spreadsheet, some don\u2019t offer any spreadsheet at all and act like I\u2019m the crazy one, some offer just a digital invoice, some only leave me the packing slip that comes in the box. Each company I order from is a different pain in the neck. \n\nThere has to be a better way. ",

Here\u2019s more about the requirements and a typical scenario we deal with:\n\n**Background:**\n\n* I am primarily a frontend developer and I'm comfortable customizing the frontend of a solution to fit specific needs.\n* I\u2019ve considered building something from scratch with a headless CMS like Strapi, but I'm exploring if there's a simpler solution out there.\n* I\u2019ve already looked into various systems including Odoo and ERPNext but am curious if there are other recommendations.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n1. **Self-Hosted or Local**: Must run locally on a PC or be self-hosted.\n2. **Inventory Management**: Capable of managing stock such as 250 kg of potatoes, 40 kg of tomatoes, etc.\n3. **Order Management**: Ability to easily create orders over the phone and input them into the system.\n4. **Recurring Clients**: Capability to save client information and automatically include it on invoices.\n5. **Invoice Generation**: After \"checking out\" an order, the system should generate a detailed invoice that includes items, quantities, prices, and custom fields.\n6. **Printing Capability**: Ability to print invoices directly from the system.\n7. **Ease of Use**: User-friendly for those with minimal technical skills.\n8. **Open Source and Cost-Effective**: Preferably open-source to allow for customization without ongoing costs.\n\n**Scenario Example:**  \nAn order comes in via phone. The operator inputs the order details, e.g., 250kg of potatoes, 40kg of tomatoes, 10kg of onions. They then proceed to \"checkout,\" and the system generates an invoice containing all the items, their prices, and includes client-specific information and custom fields.\n\nI appreciate any advice, experiences, or insights you can share, especially if you\u2019ve dealt with similar systems or setups.",

Shopify is a great e-commerce software for your website.

        "content": "I\u2019m working in the office at a local business. Basically, doing whatever they need done or researching how to get it done. I have been researching inventory management apps for the company. I was looking for something somewhat affordable and something that allows mobile phones to be used to scan things.\n\nI found one I was excited about and I thought would be a great fit for us (after doing the up front work to enter all of the UPCs) \u2026 but it turns out the boss was under the assumption that we\u2019d be able to use this app to scan UPC\u2019s and automatically populate the item name/details and I guess that is what he was excited about. \n\nMy understanding is that there isn\u2019t an inventory app that does that because you\u2019ve got to pull that information from somewhere so you\u2019ve got to initially supply the information. I imagine someone could build an app that is an inventory management app that is somehow able to cross reference UPCs on eBay or something\u2026 but I also imagine that would be a custom app build and somewhat expensive.\nMy question is, is there an app like this already?\n\nTLDR: Boss wants an inventory app that somehow auto-populates the item info instead of and before it having to be manually entered. Is that a thing?",

Through No Code your Custom tool with whatever features and integration you require can be built in a month and cost less than 7000$ (one time fee). less than an average subscription fee of a mainstream software for a medium sized organization's 2 year cost",

        "title": "We've been using inFlow Inventory for 1 year and we're done with this company",
        "content": "**We've been using inFlow for 1 year and we're f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* done with this company. Here's why:**\n\nI own a D2C brand making physical products for airsoft industry with a 3PL. Last year we hit a point where we were no longer able to keep track of all the parts required for all our products so I realized it was time to look for an MRP / inventory management solution. Keep in mind we're a 3 person team and we're by all means a small business so wasting 5k for a custom solution that doesn't even work at the end (i've seen that happen) was not really an option here. I wanted to pick a good enough self-service product.\n\nI'm a research freak so I spent probably 2 months evaluating total of 15 different MRP / ERP software solutions and being a product designer, it was important that the UI /UX of the product we chose was something that didn't look like it was made in 2000's. We also needed a solution that integrates with Shopify so we can deduct quantities we sell of the products we make from our inventory solution. That narrowed it down quite a bit and it was somewhat close between MRPEasy and inFlow Inventory but we ultimately liked the direction where inFlow was heading with their web app.\n\nWe've been now a paying customer for 1 year and it cost us \u20ac350 / month (which is pretty expensive for our scale) but if it's a good product, I wouldn't mind it.\n\nThe onboarding was very simple and we were able to import our existing data we had from spreadsheets and [Coda.io](http://Coda.io) with relative ease and their label printing software is 9/10. It's so good that they could spin it off as a service for other software companies imho.\n\nHowever... during my evaluation, I had missed one small thing - I hadn't noticed that the imported sales orders from Shopify were being picked from completely random locations (when you setup integration you need to select which *Shopify Location* matches which *inFlow Location*).\n\nWe have only 2 locations:\n\n1. 3PL Warehouse (all shopify orders)\n2. Our office (only B2B orders through inFlow showroom)\n\nWhat this means in practice is that inFlow was COMPLETELY MESSING UP OUR INVENTORY for any product that we stocked at both locations. We first noticed this 7 months in, after numerous mismatches in quantities and stock counts which we thought were just mostly our own errors with mishandling inventory or not doing it properly.\n\nNow... In a normal situation critical issues like this are reported and fixed within a reasonable timeframe however this was not the case here. **After 5 months, couple of dozen emails back and forth with customer support, our success manager and I even wrote to both co-founders, here's the current situation:**\n\n* inFlow integration on Shopify is broken for app-based locations (it cannot pull location data from orders) therefore it just picks the first location it wants where inventory is available\n* they blamed me for using a custom 3rd party app cuz it's obviously unrealistic for them to test every app yet our 3PL app (Printful, which is like one of the biggest apps on Shopify app store) uses official Shopify Fulfillment API the same which any 3PL, including 1st party Shopify Fulfillment uses\n* they said their developers have no way to test this yet Shopify's development test store comes pre-installed with app-managed location and sample order for this exact case scenario - they clearly overlooked it or didn't know it existed\n* the core issue is that their app didn't ask for this permission scope so it would require to update the app with a new permission scope which would be a bit of a hassle as most customers would have to click 1 buttons that says \"Approve\"\n* they suggested to sync only one location in the integration which makes sense - if there's only one location, then there should be only one option to pick from, right? WRONG! Even if only one location is matched on Shopify integration, it still ignores it completely and picks from wherever it wants.\n* they have not fixed this issue and they are unable to provide ANY ETA on when we could see a fix for this\n* supposedly we are literally the only ones with this issue (having one location managed by 3PL and other for our B2B orders) so it's not a priority for them to fix it, even though we paid like close to \u20ac4k over the last year and it is completely braking our inventory system which is the main thing this product does\n* nowhere on the website or documentation they have mentioned that their Shopify integration is not working with 3PL locations (because they did not know about it and even today haven't updated this info)\n* we offered them to deploy a hotfix where if they would make it so that if there's only one location synced it would only pick that one (like it should have been working in the first place). this would likely be 1-2 lines of code that would take 1 developer to fix in couple of hours - they just ignored it\n* we asked our success to at least give us a discount for the pain while they work on this issue. After talking to his manager he offered us 10% discount and tried upselling us to an annual plan in order to save a bit more...\n* after going over this issue for 5 months, they still insist that none of this is a bug but rather than we're requesting a \"feature\" for which they are unable to provide timeline due to limited resources\n* one of the co-founders replied to my \"why we are leaving inflow\" email with \"sorry, managing resources is hard and we're trying to do it better and thanks for spending time with us\" - I was hoping that someone could come to their senses on how stupid this situation has gotten and deploy a hotfix for it... silly of me, I know...\n\n**Oh and did I mention there's another bug which has been unsolved for 6 months now where if you make a new category for a product / part, it is automatically made available for every single customer on the B2B Showroom portal?** The only solution is to go and change every single account and uncheck that category unless you want to make your internal parts and components for purchase or visible to your B2B customers :)\n\nApart from their complete and utter incompetence of fixing critical issues in their software product, and their 0 fucks given customer support regarding this matter, the **rest of the product is honestly really good** **and we would really like to keep using it even though it's quite expensive**. Their interface has minor frustrating UX issues but those will surely be solved in a *couple of decades* but the overall experience is very solid, easy to use, their label printer support and software is excellent. **But this one issue that they are unwilling to fix has completely ruined the experience for us.**\n\nSo long story short, unless I want to keep giving money to a company that gives 0 fucks about us and cannot even give a decent discount in the time being in this one off edge case to make up for the issues, we have to start looking for a different product ASAP.\n\n**Let this serve as a warning to anyone looking to start using inFlow... They won't care if you have any issues.**",

At present, our organization uses BTM Supply Management. One of the major drawbacks we are seeing is that real-time tracking is not really a viable option. I'm reaching out here to see if there are any relatively inexpensive options.\n\nA little about what we need: We have a small staff with an inventory of about 200-300 individual items. The majority of items are medical supplies, including medications. We need a system that can track expiration dates and lot numbers and alert for close expirations. We would like a system that we can use the existing scannable (QR codes, mini-barcodes, etc.) so we don't have to print new labels for every item (This is a part of our current dilemma). We would prefer a system that allows for a real-time tracking that can be utilized by multiple users so that we can scan items out as we are managing a patient, even more helpful if it has an app-based component.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny help that you all can offer would be appreciated!",

I'm looking for a more efficient, scalable solution.\n\nIn an ideal state, I envision a barcode scanning and cataloging system. However, some of our wine samples do not have barcodes (due to the barcode being labeled over by the supplier, tank samples, etc.).\n\n*Requirements:*\n\n* Ability to scan in bottles **with** pre-existing barcodes to capture the bottle's information, along with date inventoried and storage location in our sample room, and to create a catalog (essentially, a spreadsheet view of our current sample supply)\n* Ability to (manually?) input samples received **without** barcodes (would be great if it could print our own unique barcode/identifier so we can then easily scan out as well)\n* Ability to scan out the samples when they're sent to a customer (so we can track when it was received, when it was sent out, and to which customer)\n\nI'd love it if it were an app, so our entire team could have access to the inventory as well.\n\nAny recommendations would be greatly appreciated!",

When you interview businesses who might benefit from your software product, you should ask them. \n\n1. What is the core problem you would like a software solution for inventory to solve for your business?\n2. Can you tell me the story of what happened that led you to look for a solution to the problem you encountered? \n\nWhen you ask the client - what the problem is and how it began and what is the journey of pain leading to looking for a solution, you have a framework for what to build your software around. If you ask this question and more say similar stories you might see trends which indicates a hole exists in the market. \n\nAs you go about this process - you\u2019ll discover things. \n\nYou might find that spreadsheets is the top level problem. But as you dig deeper you will find more. \n\nI did this research early on with clients. \n\n1. Spreadsheets don\u2019t scale\n2. They don\u2019t offer real time inventory since they aren\u2019t updated on time.\n3. Only 1 person knows the formulas and if he gets hit by a bus the business is done \n\u2026\u2026\n\n\nDig deeper and you find out more to the problems beyond the surface when you talk to business owners. \n1. Spreadsheets don\u2019t scale when I\u2019m hiring people and everybody is trying to update the spreadsheets we use and some forget or do it wrong\u2026 \n2. I forgot to update the inventory once and ran out of stock of an item with a 3 month lead time and lost 10k in sales because I couldn\u2019t fulfill orders. Crested bad reputation in my market because of it. \n3. I the business owner am fixing all the bad spreadsheet formulas and I cant spend time focusing on growing my business\u2026. \n\n\nOkay - so now we are getting somewhere. Features are supposed to create a solution that makes them better than spreadsheets, but they must also make a solution that solves a business problem that affects the company\u2026. \n\nWhen you dig deeper, find the stories of the clients that suffer and make that your mission to solve the client problem there, don\u2019t get too lost in the technicalities. \n\nHope that helps :)",

The challenge? We're stuck in a cycle of overstocking and under-stocking, and it's causing us a massive headache.\n\nTo complicate matters, our production takes a solid month, and logistics add an extra three weeks to the mix. Considering our sales are expected to decrease post-holiday season, it's become an even trickier. I've attached a screenshot of our current inventory, sales in the last 30 days, and more details. If you need additional info, feel free to ask.\n\nI desperately need advice on when and how much to order \u2013 it's become a  real puzzle for me. Tackling this inventory dilemma is a bit overwhelming as I do not have much experience. Any and all  advice would be immensely appreciated.\n\nThank you.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/88rvnb0rm8ec1.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&s=511193774dbe860a28489fac5c57d263bfa52587",

I bought a brother QL-820 series label printer that came with an official brother thermal paper roll. However it is not laminated! It fades away with time. I use my handheld brother label maker when labelling cables and such, and that doesn't fade away because it has a layer of plastic on top.  A temporary solution I have found is to use transparent tape on top of the label to prevent it from fading away, but the point of all this is to make a life easier, not harder. I tried contacting local office suppliers but no one sells 62mm continuous laminated rolls of paper. And at this point I don't even know if those even exist. Any suggestions?",

Normally, the same order with my last purchase price would cost me $84,000 USD, resulting in $31,000 USD in savings. However, I would like to analyze how much it will cost me to increase my inventory and pay upfront for this. These 6 kits would cover the demand for the entire year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ccnwrbbhwcc1.png?width=431&format=png&auto=webp&s=1264c8f5162014357d79c7ee871cedf232f5cc6c\n\nDoes anyone have a methodology for evaluating this type of decisions? I feel this case is quite common, so maybe this one, in particular, isn't worth it, but I would like to know how to quantify this for different scenarios.  I feel that, currently in my company, there isn't a lot of communication between the warehouse and procurement. Perhaps this type of analysis can help build that relationship and facilitate informed decisions, not just focusing on price variances from the procurement side.\n\nThanks in advance for any help!!!",

I work for a company that sells Sports Gear both online and in two physical retail location. We also have a partner who has his own Amazon store which carries our brand, but his products also come from our warehouse and this is where the problem arises.\n\nCurrently, we don't have any serious inventory tracking system, so many times when our partner sells something, we actually don't have it and he has no way of knowing until an issue has already been created. My boss and him are looking for software that will track the quantity of certain products across two physical/retail locations, one Shopify e-commerce store, and one Amazon store.\n\nAdditional issues: the items we are looking to track do not currently have matching SKUs in their online locations. I can fix that with quite the effort but would prefer software that could possibly track one item with multiple SKUs. Next, I do not believe any of or retail products have a proper barcode to scan, so any advice on how I should go about resolving that issue would be very welcome. \n\nSorry if this is all a lot and/or not completely possible, I was handed this by someone with even less of a clue so I could use all the advice I can get. I'll try to answer any follow-up questions as I'm sure I've omitted some details. Thanks in advance y'all.",

But there are a few options for this most likely, including Finale or Unleashed. Are you doing any material tracking with assembly or are strictly a reseller?\n\nAre you running POS as well via your retail location? If so, what system? \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ll need some key features from the inventory management solutions.\n\n1. Multi-location inventory tracking\n2. Shopify and Amazon integrations that support order pull, order fulfillment sync, order routing to location and stock sync\n3. Possibly POS integration - but if you Shopify POS then that\u2019s a great option (I know katana supports this very well too)\n4. You probably will have other apps/tools to integrate into your stack which are biz critical (like accounting)\n\nWhat is your total SKU count? It\u2019s going to become important to get SKUs matching. I think there are certain use-cases where you might need to use an alternative SKU for Amazon and may need a 3rd party integrator to help manage this to bridge with a cloud inventory solution\u2026 \n\nOtherwise, it is highly advised you have SKUs match between your IMS, Ecomm, POS and Amazon if possible. This is usually necessary because Stock syncs are typically designed to work based on SKU matching. \n\nHope that helps",

It will streamline your operations across all your sales channels (physical stores, Shopify, and your partner's Amazon store). Here's what to look for:\n\nMulti-location Tracking: The software should track inventory levels across all your locations in real time. This eliminates stock-outs and ensures you can fulfill orders accurately.\n\nMultiple SKU Support: Many systems can handle products with different SKUs on various platforms. This saves you the hassle of constantly updating SKUs and ensures accurate data.\n\nBarcode Integration: Barcode scanning is a game-changer for efficient inventory management. Look for software that integrates with barcode scanners for faster and more accurate stock updates.\n\nI've had success using GEP\u2019s supply chain software for complete inventory management. It's been particularly helpful with mostly all the pain points you've mentioned.\n\n\nHaving said that, the best solution depends on your budget, team size, and specific needs.\u00a0\n\n\nIt might be worth exploring demos or trials of some options to see what fits best! You can also check out the Gartner, Forrester, and ISG reports. They rank all the top software and it\u2019s a good starting point for figuring out what\u2019s what.\u00a0",

        "content": "This is likely the first time I\u2019ve used reddit to ask for advise in solving a real-life problem (most of the time it was for gaming).  \n\nHere goes! So, a couple months ago I started working at a coffee roasting factory that has 11 production lines, 5 roasters, 6 grinders (mills), 3 shifts per day (1 extra on the weekends) and somewhere close to 100 operators. \n\nI\u2019m the supply chain administrative assistant of the factory (basically a hands-on secretary) and I take care of everything from daily production reports, production planning support, clothing for the operators, invoicing, etc. to basic inventory tracking/monitoring.  \n\nThis is where it is getting tricky for me. \n\nA few days ago, my boss told me that we needed to revisit and start the tool inventory ASAP, and after they taught me how to do it, I realized (and let them know) it was super time consuming, archaic and with no real tracking what-so-ever. It\u2019s been a couple of months since the last inventory was made (they fired the person before me), and it seems the operators tend to \u201cmisplace\u201d or \u201close\u201d tools rather frequently. \n\nI want to take advantage of the situation to propose a new way to face this issue and make tool inventory management easier (for me, mostly) and more organized, while trying to avoid tools being misplaced and that the operators can be held accountable at some level (responsibilitywise). Here\u2019s what I know: \n\n1- Each production line has its own tool kit that\u2019s specific for that machine, with some of them being for general use. \n\n2- Operators can carry around a small handbag (like a medium sized makeup bag) with tape and little things. According to my boss and some other coworkers, they can fit some tools in there or we can provide them with a more suitable bag for a few tools. \n\n3- There\u2019s in no program available for inventory, just a plain, old spreadsheet. \n\n4- I already have a list of tools for each production line that can help me figure out the common ones and the specific ones. The most basic ones are really basic tools, like Allen wrenches, fixed wrenches, screwdrivers, etc. I can also go talk to the operators and ask what tools they actually use/need for that specific production line. \n\n5- As far as surveillance goes, I don\u2019t have the clearance to access the cameras, nor they can/care/want to really get behind every single misplacement as it would be a lot of time and resources consumed. \n\n6- Right now, if a tool gets missing, they just replace it and that\u2019s that; but my boss, and the maintenance team, are always complaining about how that doesn\u2019t work and how it\u2019s a complete mess that no one will fix because of the last part of point 5. \n\n7- 90% of the operators have been here a long time (5+ years at least), if that helps with the brainstorming. \n\nI was thinking about listing the common tools and assigning a \u201ccommon tool kit\u201d to each and every operator as their own basic starting kit and having a \u201cspecific tool kit\u201d assigned to each production line so they can use it whenever and place them back when done. \n\nThe thing is that this does not entirely fix the misplacement issue, as the specific tools must still be assigned to the production line and not the operator. \n\nHow would you face this? What am I missing?  \n\nI need ideas to write down a plan and present it. I already have a green light to test my (our, if you so kindly help me lol) plan on one of the biggest lines and see what happens, but I need a solid proposal to be able to start. \n\nAny input is greatly appreciated! If you feel you need more information, just let me know and I\u2019ll do my best to explain. \n\nSorry if there are any misspellings, English is not my first language. ",

Sort (Seiri): The first step is to sort through all items in the manufacturing area and remove any unnecessary or unused items. This helps to reduce clutter and create more space for essential items.\n\n2. Set in Order (Seiton): Once unnecessary items have been removed, the next step is to organize the remaining items in a logical and efficient manner. This involves assigning specific locations for each item and ensuring that they are easily accessible to workers when needed.\n\n3. Shine (Seiso): This step involves thoroughly cleaning the manufacturing area, including equipment, tools, and work surfaces. Regular cleaning helps to maintain a safe and hygienic work environment.\n\n4. Standardize (Seiketsu): Standardization involves establishing clear guidelines and procedures for maintaining the organized and clean manufacturing area. This includes creating visual cues, such as labels or signs, to indicate the proper location for each item.\n\n5. Sustain (Shitsuke): The final step is to sustain the \"everything in its place\" principle by regularly reviewing and maintaining the organized state of the manufacturing area. This involves training employees on the importance of organization and cleanliness and conducting regular audits to ensure compliance.\n\nBy implementing the \"everything in its place\" principle and following the 5S methodology, manufacturers can create a more efficient and productive work environment, reduce waste and errors, and improve overall safety and quality.",

I.e. tracking data in spreadsheets - I recommend the cloud based ones (Airtable, Monday, etc...) so that you can get a handle on what is accurate and what is not within your ERP system. Once you can real inventory in your secondary system, I recommend working with your finance team to put together a cleanup plan for your ERP. Usually if you can work with your accounting/finance team that will give you the power to make changes to your company's systems",

        "content": "I have recently been tasked with managing a brand new small business that puts together large finished goods for customers. Since the company just started, there are no formal processes / systems / etc. in place, and I am looking to start off on a strong foot so that everything is in place for when it inevitably grows. Note I have no inventory experience, so this is all first time for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackground of what I am to be dealing with: The company needs to put together about 5-10 large products per month, each of which include putting together \\~40 pieces of raw material inventory to reach the final finished good to sell. So it isn't a ton, but it should grow quickly based on projections. Therefore, I want some type of system to be able to track my inventory with beginning inventory (with raw materials), purchases, work in process, finished goods, and ending inventory. I am thinking some type of barcoding system with SKUs will help too. If I have about 40-50 different types of raw materials on my shelves, I can create 50 separate barcodes for each location. At the end of each day (or week), an employee can scan the barcode and enter into scanner the amount they count and do this for each.  Then it'd be able to be converted to a spreadsheet / system. Is there such thing? I feel like that'd eliminate the whole paper counting and slowness there. Again - I am new, and a lot came up on Google so wanted to get some feedback from other owners here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother note - I would say I am advanced with Excel, so I can start with using Excel to track Inventory. But I feel for long-term success and with organizational growth, implementing and beginning with some type of inventory software system would be in my best interest. Feel free to ask me questions as I am trying to learn and figure out what is best.",

        "content": "Hi!  \n\n\nI recently started a residential/commercial cleaning business with my partner. The day we got our business license we went to the beach for sunset. While at the beach we started talking to this guy playing guitar and he mentioned he's opening a small resort just across the road. So we said that we actually just started our own cleaning services and jokingly said \"If you ever need cleaners, we're right here.\" which he took literally. After some more talking, he asked us to come over to the nearly-complete resort and give him a quick quote.\n\nFast forward to the current moment, and they are seriously thinking of signing a contract with us to clean their units. And up until now, I haven't had many hiccups. But now they want me to manage their guest amenity inventory, which would be fine if I knew how to quote it. I get the gist of how to manage inventory, but I don't know how I should charge. It's only 8 relatively small units, but I have no idea how long it takes to count, order, organize, and stock inventory, so I have no basis for how many hours it will take me.\n\nAny help or opinions are appreciated. Thank you!",

Free or very very low cost software (school won\u2019t fund us at all);\n\n2. Easy for students to check-in/out books.

Easy to maintain as I\u2019ll be handing this over to others when I leave the school at the end of next year.\n\nLet me know if any of you know of software that can do this. Of course most platforms will have many more features which we don\u2019t need, but as long as we can use it as needed it\u2019ll be great.\n\nEdit: It\u2019s also a self-serve system and isn\u2019t necessarily monitored, so students will just check-out their own books and bring them back when finished using them.",

Here are some I think can help you:\r\r\n\n**1. Odoo Inventory:**\n\nIt's user friendly and can handle tasks like tracking inventory levels, managing shipments, and integrating with e-commerce platforms.\r\n\nIt offers a double-entry inventory system. It's possible to track every stock movement from purchase to warehouse bin to sales order. Track lots or serial numbers upstream or downstream.\r\n\nIt offers a free plan for basic inventory features but if you want more advanced ones, you'll need to pay. I think as your business grows, you can do that.\r\n\n**2. inFlow Inventory:**\n\nIt offers in-depth product tracking, extensive order management, and a comprehensive multi-location management system.\r\n\nIt offers a free version with a limited number of products. If you want more advanced features and support, you need to upgrade to their paid plans.\r\n\n**3. Zoho Inventory:**\n\nIt helps you track stock levels, manage orders, and integrate with other Zoho applications and more.\r\n\nIt offers a mobile app and a free plan with basic features.\r  \n\r  \n**4. QuickBooks:**\n\nIt's user-friendly and popular among small and midsize businesses. It offers inventory tracking features that let you monitor stock levels, manage purchase orders, generate reports, track expenses, sales and more.\r\n\nWhile it offers a free trial, it's a paid service.\r\n\nYou can also use CRMs for basic inventory management to scale your business like Monday that combines customer and inventory management. Asana and Salesforce can also be helpful for that.\r\n\nThey may not have full-on management inventory features but they still can help. You can check out their communities here on Reddit and ask about more specific ways they can help you with inventory.",

That does pose a bit of a unique challenge from an inventory management standpoint ... \n\nTypically I'd have a lot of questions. But I'll try to keep it short and relevant.\n\nThe answer you don't likely want to hear is that to actually TRACK the inventory with any level of accuracy then it needs its own item number or unique identifier. Especially if its going to sit somewhere and is not headed out on a customer order right when it's built/assembled. Barcoding will naturally help facilitate all this.\n\nIf it is truly like a thirft store and everything is unique one offs, this would get ugly fast. Requiring a lot of maintenance to just feed the system. If so, it might be better to just accept some slop and waste with C items and only track the A items with a high dollar value.",

Today we use google sheets to manually write when we produce a flavour in our kitchen, then when it gets shipped to another shop, and when the final shop is using it.\nAs Google Sheet is not the most inituative app to use, we now look for another solution. Kinda something like warehouse.\n\nFirst we will have the kichen who produces Ice Cream. As they produce it and store it in the freezer, we want them to maybe use a QR code or something that is printed to log it in the system. So the stock of the spesific ice cream flavour increases.\n\nThen when some of the (multiple) stores needs to order some Ice Cream, the kitchen scans the flavours that is going to be transported.\n\nWhen a store received the shipment, they scan all the flavours they have gotten.\n\nFinally when the store is going to take a flavour out of the fridge in order to sell it, they have to again scan the QR code.\n\nThe QR Code is wanted in order to see production date and time, and to track the whole process.\n\nIs this something that would have been able to solve with an inventory magament app? Any ideas?\n\nThe money isnt the problem, but to find the best solution that makes the whole process easier. Maybe building an app would be a solution, but I hope to find something that already exists which can be tweaked in the way we want.\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "content": "Hello all, reaching out in hopes someone may have a decent suggestion. We started a business a few years back which has grown quickly and past what I believe excel can handle\u2026 maybe?? The main issue is finding a inventory system that is more of an advanced system. I have looked into QuickBooks as some others in the industry used to use this system before they got \u201csuper big\u201d. And now they have custom built systems. A bit about us, We import \u201cflat pack\u201d items and sometimes sell them flat pack, or assembled. There are roughly 400 SKUS per color within the product line. We also sometime buy products from other vendors bring them into our facility, build them, then sell them. \n\nThe additional complication, is sometimes I buy a container and the cost is $8,000 for shipping and fees and sometimes it is $20,000 the shipping industry dictates that. And I want to make sure the appropriate costs are associated to the appropriate products each time. I have met with a few accountants and a consultant group and everyone suggests QuickBooks but I\u2019m still not sure it has the capabilities we are in need of. Any chance someone on here can help out with either last experience, thoughts on systems etc?\n\nThank you to any and all!",

They do not have any triggers to when to reorder the product, and they type in everything manually.\n\nMy objective is to create an inventory management system to ensure clear picture of inventory (track stage, expected arrival of products & shipping supplies) (it also needs to align with shopify inventory), then ensure that cost of goods is accurate and current, and finally create accurate triggers for placing new product and supply order (and quantity).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations or any other subs I should explore to give me ideas on what I should be doing (turns out what they are teaching us in college is outdated and I cannot use those resources).\n\nAlso, I am familiar with VBA but only used it in class setting. So, I guess there is a way to incorporate a scanning system, I just do not know how that would work and what is needed.\n\nThank you very much!",

        "title": "Advice on inventory management and consignment software",
        "content": "(Cross Posted) I\u2019m looking for some advice on inventory management and consignment software. I\u2019ll provide a little background on myself to provide some context.\n\nWe have an antique shop and, while we do have some in-store sales, the vast majority of our sales are online. We sell on multiple platforms: eBay, Etsy, Chairish, and Shopify (which hosts our individual store page). We currently use Sellbrite as our primary listing platform. The way this works is that we create listings for our items on Sellbrite, and then post to eBay, Etsy, and Shopify from there. Since Sellbrite doesn\u2019t sync with Chairish, we have to post inventory to Chairish separately.\n\nThe inventory management system we currently use is Sortly, but we are hoping to switch IMS platforms in the hopes of using a platform that can handle both inventory management, as well as manage consignors. The reason for this is we have started taking on consignments (and plan to really ramp up that effort in the near future), and we\u2019ll need to have some type of consignment software that can: (1) keep track of our various consignors, (2) match inventory with specific consignors, and (3) store documents (e.g., contracts, payout forms, etc.).\n\nOne product we\u2019ve found that looks like it may suit our needs is ConsignCloud. They have a fairly robust inventory tracking system that allows for detailed item location tracking, SKU barcode scanning, and more. They also offer consignment management as part of the same package. The major drawback is that they don\u2019t sync with Sellbrite. (ConsignCloud does sync with Shopify, but since Sellbrite is the starting point for our listings, this does little good for us.) This is not necessarily a deal-breaker for us, as we could simply use ConsignCloud as a way to track the location of items in our store and warehouse, as well as a way to keep track of our consignors (including what items they\u2019ve consigned with us, payout forms, etc.). And then we can use Sellbrite to manage our listings.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m posting is I\u2019m curious to hear whether anyone out there is in a similar situation and has advice to share. We\u2019ve looked into whether any IMS/Consignment software exists that can sync with Sellbrite, but haven\u2019t found anything.\n\nWe\u2019re also open to general suggestions about how to better handle consignments and inventory (to repeat: we need to be able to both track and regularly update inventory locations, as well as post inventory on our various sales platforms). To be honest, as our store has grown and continues to grow, we\u2019ve kind of cobbled together a patchwork system to handle our various needs. But it\u2019s very possible there are better ways of managing things. It would be great, for example, if a single system could: (1) post listings on various online platforms; (2) keep track of detailed inventory locations; and (3) handle our consignment needs. To our knowledge, this system doesn\u2019t exist (at least at a price point we could afford). But we also don\u2019t have a lot knowledge about what exists, so we figured we\u2019d reach out to see whether anyone else has insight or experience they\u2019d be willing to share. Thanks in advance!",

        "title": "What are the solutions to the most common inventory management issues?",
        "content": " Modern businesses in 2020 have realized that inventory management software are necessary to run an efficient phone repair shop. Especially in today's competitive marketplace, repair store owners can't afford to have the money go down the drain. So, let's take a look at the most common inventory management issues, and learn how a POS software for repair stores can help in avoiding them.\n\n[BuzzFeed](https://preview.redd.it/70fblj781p941.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef992ce13c259bfdbb521d45ec93238bf7bda55e)\n\n**Challenge 1: The Unknown Inventory**\n\nTake a holistic view of knowing both essential vs. non-essential items and when they should be ordered. Essential items are those that are either trending or the items you sell year-round and need continuous replenishing of stock.\n\nHowever, knowing your core items is just the first step in overcoming the significant challenges. You must then understand, what is in stock, what is going to be ordered, and what needs to be restocked. Knowing your inventory can be a very heavy task but critical to ensuring profitable business operations. This is where a good POS system can help you the most.\n\n**Challenge 2: Manual Inventory Tracking**\n\nManual inventory tracing practices such as using a spreadsheet are one of the first tools that businesses use when setting up their cellphone repair stores. However, if you have a large business with multiple store outlets and you're using paper, excel sheets, or any manual process to track inventory, you are just inviting problems.\n\nManual inventory management is not reliable for real-time information because it may lead to wrong inventory counts as the inventory numbers may be very different from 8 am and 7 pm. These inaccuracies can be the root of excessive inventory or, worse, inadequate inventory. Either way, this situation is going to result in unhappy or lost customers.\n\nThe best way to solve this is to get automated through a POS Software for Repair Store. An ideal POS solution offers real-time inventory tracking, gives low-stock warnings, performs inventory counts, notifies about reorder levels, and generates purchase orders in no time.\n\n**Challenge 3: Decentralized Inventory Records**\n\nWhen you centralize inventory items, you are managing your inventory from one central point for all of your repair stores. The power in 'centralizing' is that you can control your routine operations like reordering, buying, or receiving from one single dashboard instead of switching different platforms for each channel. With greater control comes better efficiency. A centralized inventory record makes it easy to manage multi-channel orders and inventory levels. Product information and the exact stock on hand for each product will create a better customer experience.\n\n**Challenge 4: Lack of Transparency**\n\nAccording to IBM, 79% of the store owners report that lack of transparency has a significant impact on business profits. Businesses these days build transparency into their operations to make sure employees and customers know what is happening to items. Even with the most up-to-date inventory management strategy, issues with orders can still occur. If your customer is aware of order delays, they can change their expectations and feel confident that their item will still arrive. Communication and transparency are essential to your success, which includes notifying the customer about their requested item when it comes back in stock.\n\nThe Solution: A Cloud-Based Inventory Management & Repair Store Software\n\nA proactive inventory management system is no longer fiction or a dream. If you haven't already chosen a POS Software for Repair Store, you need to consider investing in an automated inventory control system. That will remove manual processes and improve the efficiency of your inventory management practices.\n\nBy using a smart inventory management solution, your business can access accurate data in real-time. It means your business can make valuable insights for better forecasting. It also offers useful time-saving automation that can streamline business processes. So, say good-bye to complex inventory management and let automation do its work.  \n [https://www.buzzfeed.com/repairdesk/solution-to-the-most-common-challenges-in-real-tim-eoh43jbe6y](https://www.buzzfeed.com/repairdesk/solution-to-the-most-common-challenges-in-real-tim-eoh43jbe6y)",

For my summer internship and after college job, I got hired as a supply chain and operations manager for a new startup. I am tasked with managing inventory, handling suppliers, process improvement, and so on. My company that I work for is in the end stages of having people test the product. In about 2 months, I believe we will have lots of demand due to future orders promised and my overall belief in the product and innovative technology behind it. The company manufactures the product itself due to the complexity of it. The finished product uses about 100 different parts when all said and done. Some of the parts received are custom made for us and others require fabrication before assembly due to the extra costs of having the supplier do it. We can not afford an ERP system or any expensive software currently to manage all this due to the initial seed money going into the R&D of the product. We have investors lined up who plan on investing a significant amount of money after the proof of concept and initial sales are completed though.  Now that you have my background and know the situation, I wanted to see if anyone has any advice for creating a system that will help manage  all of this. The company is using just a google docs for the BOM, Inventory, and other functions. This will work fine now but when orders start to come in it will be impossible to maintain due to the complexity of assembly, inventory, and so on. Currently, I am leaning towards setting up a database system on access and using excel for other tasks like forecasting. If anyone has advice on if you think this is a good idea or  have any other suggestions for software that I can use that is free or very inexpensive. Thank you and sorry for the long post.",

Not only is the website slow to load, reload, refresh it is not initiative. It seems you can only buy one inventory item from one vendor in keeping track of amounts. For example: you can't buy the same type of milk from multiple vendors without it showing up twice in your inventory list. This also messes up menu items. \nIt doesn't seem intuitive at all. \n\nI don't know anyone likes it. \n\nI can see the benefit of having an inventory management system, but there has to be one that is more intuitive than this one. \n\nI would rather just use the QBO inventory system.

        "content": "&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHello, I have recently been asked to unofficially manage the inventory for the company I work for in addition to my current role, there are many moving pieces as it based off of productions, I have started keeping track of a relatively small inventory ( about 400 SKUs) most of which we keep a low quantity on hand.\n\nMost of my inventory is constantly Movhile other departments have people in place for this in their area it doesn't quite fit or apply to my specific area.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of my inventory is constantly moving, We receive replenishments daily on all items based off an automated logic system. My question is I am to maintain that inventory on our shelves matches what is in our management system. I have made a Cycle count Schedule that will complete a full cycle count for all inventory approximately every month (every 20 business days).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is a good frequency for Cycle counts? Obviously the more often counted the more accurate inventory is, but this is not my only role and I only have so much time per day to dedicate to this. but if inventory gets too far off production runs into hiccups as the automatic replenishment will not occur if our inventory does not drop below a certain % of its max capacity (broken or scrapped inv not accounted for or recorded).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf there is anyone With experience managing inventories ina production business that would be willing to weigh in, I would greatly appreciate your input.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: How often should I cycle counting if my Company doesn't have a set standard or preference? once per month? once per quarter?",

I've found to its easier to count Thing A but thing D is a pain/tedious. That way I know what I can put off if something else requires my time/attention. My employer has a 3 month full warehouse count that repeats, every 3 months. As you count more and more of the same product you get better at counting/seeing what is/isn't moving. Also the level that the auto-order activates can usually be modified up or down, which is useful if you can clearly see a consistant low stock of a high demand/ important item. My company is more of a retail based not production, we don't \"make\" anything but we fill orders for people on tight/costly schedules. I hope this helps, good luck!",

The owner is not exactly computer literate, so we are looking for an easy and basic to use system, with online invoicing, sales tracking for future sale analysis reports as well as generating barcodes. This would need to be able to be accessed via our computers and tablets, which can be accessed from anywhere via a cloud. \n\nWe are also looking to move away from paper invoicing, and instead be able to provide customer invoicing via email which is completed on site via the tyre fitters phone/tablet. \n\nIf there are any systems that are able to provide us with these and possibly more, but also if a more tyre orientated system exists, this would be preferable. \n\n\nThanks guys!",

        "title": "How Software changes the face of Inventory Management ?",
        "content": "Inventory is the lifeblood of a retail business. Managing it well is very important. Poor inventory management is the main reason of small businesses fail.\n\nWhat goes wrong?\n\nUsually, a cascade of errors leads to bad decisions. In an environment of strong competition and low margins, small businesses simply can\u2019t afford such miscalculations.\n\nIf you overestimate demand, inventory builds up, costing money to store and eventually hitting the sell-by date or going out of style before it\u2019s sold. Conversely, underestimating demand frustrates customers, who may give up and go elsewhere.\n\nYes of course, you can never forecast demand with 100% accuracy, but if you don\u2019t have correct, up-to-date numbers to start with, you don\u2019t have a chance of getting it right. Unfortunately, that\u2019s often the case.\n\nWhy so many mistakes?\n\nAccording to research  43% of small business owners are still using pen-and-paper systems or spreadsheets to track inventory. Manual systems are rife with data-entry errors that lead to shipping mistakes costing time and money. Worse, they lead to incorrect forecasting, which can be catastrophic.\n\nThe Software Solution\n\nPoint-of-sale software systems provide pinpoint accuracy, but small businesses often fear the expense of investing in technology like barcode scanners or RFID tags.\n\nNo matter how comprehensive your resource planning is, if your inventory data is wrong, it won\u2019t help you. Though inventory software can be expensive, software vendors face heavy competition,just as retailers do and many offer solutions and pricing attractive to small businesses.\n\nBird\u2019s-Eye View\n\nIf inventory software is cloud-based, it allows business owners to see their stock in real time, either at a single store or across multiple locations. Dashboards help managers visualize information in a variety of formats, and they can access the system anywhere from a PC or mobile device.\n\nInventory software can be integrated with an ERP system to make forecasting easier and more accurate. It can also work with online sales, making it especially helpful in today\u2019s omnichannel environment. Some retailers pass inventory data to online customers, who can find out how many items are left for a product they\u2019re interested in, or whether a specialty item is available at a specific store.\n\nIT Outsourcing\n\nIT Outsourcing,as retailers scale,their cloud-based software can grow along with them, switching seamlessly to new shippers or scanning systems and calculating prices differently for larger accounts.\n\nWhile these powerful systems are easy to use once they\u2019re set up, making decisions about which features to deploy and how to integrate them can be complex. Today\u2019s omnichannel strategies incorporate many different technologies for mobility, social media, logistics, and data analytics. The scope of knowledge required to implement them is often beyond the capability of the average retail IT shop,thats why retailers are increasingly outsourcing the work.\n\nInventory management is crucial to retail success. Whether it means upgrading to cloud-based software or getting help to manage complex systems, today\u2019s retailers are not just hoping for a bright future, they\u2019re investing in it and how connection helps. Our team of IT experts can help retailers streamline inventory management, leveraging a mix of bar code and RFID technology, cloud-based software solutions, and critical updates to infrastructure to optimize forecasts and save time and money.",

        "title": "Attempted Theft and Carrier411 Fraud?",
        "content": "I have been free of fraud issues for just under three years and was a point of pride. I finally got tripped up, this group was good but, that is not an excuse for ignoring my gut and being complacent. Luckily, I was able to identify the issue before any real consequences and stopped the attempted freight theft before it could occur but now a reputable carrier has become victim to a fraudulent freightguard report on Carrier411 that is hurting their ability to do business. So here is the story, with the evidence.\n\nWe had a reefer load picking up in NE heading to TX and my ops guy took a call from VOKHID TRANSPORTATION MC 1226568 DOT 3573700. During the call they provided the driver\u2019s real name, phone number, truck, and trailer number. These are all required for checking in at the shipper and required by us before booking a load. Their background seemed off but the driver had accepted tracking and my ops guy spoke with the driver to confirm ETA and let it ride.\n\nThe driver checked in to the shipper (drop trailer) and was laid over due to delays on site. The next morning when the driver checked in to grab the trailer there was an issue with them having the wrong trailer number which raised a red flag but the driver and truck # matched so, while I thought it was odd I decided to keep a close eye on the load and tracking. An hour later when following up on my gut I realized that the truck was heading West instead of South and contacted the driver.\n\nDuring this phone call I realized that the driver was not driving with GOSMART but the dispatcher had received a rate confirmation from THOR XPRESS 3PL MC 601820. Who is a victim of identity theft, I spoke with a person over there and confirmed my suspicions.\u00a0 I also provided them with the documentation so they could clean up their issues as well.\n\nThe driver had also received a call from this fraudster, impersonating Thor Xpress, claiming the load was changed to deliver to a Target in Fontana, CA and would pay in cash at delivery. \n\nAfter some more questioning he finally provided me his companies information JDS Trans MC 870454. English wasn't  his first language so getting this information out was a process.\n\nI contacted JDS Trans and informed them of what was happening and they sent me over all the emails and documentation they had from the fraudster and we were able to get them set up and heading in the right direction. Luckily, we were able to prevent the theft of the load and I thought saved this carrier from issues but I was wrong.\n\nShortly after we got them all set up and good to go they received a notification that a freightguard report had been assigned to them by ACE TRUCKLOAD, LLC by a Jane Watson.\n\nThis FreightGuard report reads;\n\n\u201cSCAMMER ALERT !!!!!! THEY STOLE OUR FREIGHT AND REQUESTED FOR PAYMENT . SCAMMER . PICKED PIR LOAD UPIN NEBRASKAGOING TO GA AND DELIVER IT TO THEIR CALIFORNIA WAREHOUSE AND ASKED FOR A PAYMENT TO TELL US THE PLACE THEY HAD DROPPED THE FREIGHT OFF AFTER SENDING THE PAYMENT THEY DIDN\u2019T ANSWER OUR CALLS AND EMAILS\u201d\n\n\u00a0Interestingly enough, the first number listed on the freightguard report 779-704-4825, does not work and the second number listed (not visible on Carrier411, but provided in the notification to the carrier) 847-496-0626 does work but nobody is able to confirm the existence of a Jane Watson. The person I spoke with at the 847# also stated that they are not located at the physical address listed in the freightguard report. After making a follow up phone call to ACE Truckload, the person quickly responded letting me know that they had the freightguard report removed and indicated that their Carrier411 account may have been hacked.\n\nI have emailed the email address listed on the freightguard report and at this time I have not received a response.\n\nAfter reading through the email thread, I noticed that this fraudster using the email [operations@thorxpress3pl.com](mailto:operations@thorxpress3pl.com) had been posting this load on DAT and communicating with them since 10/28, well before our load was even posted. I believe these people at GOSMART are either hacking DAT and Carrier411 accounts to harass carriers into committing fraud or it is a combined effort with ACE TRUCKLOAD to target specific areas and steal freight through double brokering. \n\nShould the plans be interrupted they then harass and target the carrier with fraudulent freightguard reports and other various reporting systems to bully the carrier into sticking to the theft and hurting their ability to operate in this market.\n\nJDS Trans has reached out to Carrier 411 to submit their side of the story but as of right now the freight guard report remains up at the time of writing.\n\nMy main purpose for writing this is mainly to help clear JDS Trans name and allow them to continue to operate as they are a good and honest carrier. Also, to highlight how FreightGuard reports are being weaponized even by fraudsters through either hacking accounts or by working with established accounts. \n\nThis also highlights a coordinated and well thought out effort by these bad actors to target specific areas to steal freight by securing trucks before actually double brokering and why brokers should always trust their gut and to not let complacency put you at risk of fraud.",

Let me know your thoughts.\n\n1-Proposed Tariffs by Trump on Chinese products on January will make manufacturers want to import as much products now before January from overseas to avoid paying extra taxes when Trump gets in office and make tariffs law. So unexpected last minute more volumes will be added to an already anticipated tight market for Holidays \n\n2- Trump for the first time signaled that he will actually have a say in interest rates so interest cuts won't be a decision purely based on the economy but rather what Trump wants - So race to lowest possible interest rate - More money circulating economy generally means more freight\n\n3- All illegal drivers and Mexican carriers excess capacity who are taking cheap loads will disappear from US trucking system before or on January when Trump assume office because ICE will ramp up efforts to deport and there are higher chance to be stopped by a police officer when your are driving day and night vs working as a cashier. \n\n4- Even legal immigrants will fear trucking all over because certain violations (speeding, DUI, etc.) on a CDL tend to disqualify the moral character requirement to obtain a green card and getting naturalized and those immigration rules tend to be enforced in full extend under Trump so risk is too high vs a normal 9-5 job so even legal immigrants will have an incentive not to drive which will bleed out capacity even further.\n\n  \n5- In historical context, a lot of capacity leave the market on winter when weather gets cold as they are already on a financial strain and one breakdown away from bankruptcy.\n\n",

                "body": "I don't see this coming to pass... 2 months ago, I would have agreed the market swing was headed back into carriers favor in terms of rates.  FMCSA's new Registration Fraud Squad is expected to revoke over 6k carrier and broker authorities that currently do not meet federal compliance rules.  41k other brokers and carriers have questionable data regarding their compliance status, thus they also risk losing their authorities.  In late November, carriers that are not complaint under the Clearinghouse regulations will have their CDL's downgraded, affecting approximately 171k drivers, dramatically reducing capacity in the market.  The exit of these stakeholders due to enforcement of federal regulations will alone bring the market back into balance.  The upcoming Trump administration is poised to throw a curveball at this turn, and possibly drive us back into a freight recession.  The question is going to be if the reduction in carriers and brokers in the market will overpower the reduction in freight (imports since we are consumer based market instead of a production based market) that is coming from the implementation of the incoming administration's promise of new tariffs against all countries.  If we are counting on US production to counter the reduction of imports, it will take literally 5 or more years to move backwards in our economy... We have to build more plants, source more raw materials in US borders, find more labor to work in these plants once they are built.  This will not be an overnight effort.  It will not even be able to be accomplished in one presidential term. We will see in about 6 months if revocation of non-complaint authorities and downgrades of non-complaint CDL holders will have a strong enough impact to overcome the economic damage to the freight market from new tariffs.\n\nPoint 1 - The proposed tariffs will reduce imports when they go into effect.  If they go into effect in January, it is already too late to order foreign goods to arrive and clear customs in time to avoid the tariffs.  There will be no \"pre-administration freight surge\" as OP suggests.  It takes 2 weeks to cross the Pacific, another month to get into the port at Long Beach to unload.  That leaves 3 weeks for orders to be placed, manufactured, and loaded onto ships.  This is not very likely to happen that fast.  That means that Trump tariffs will actually cause an inflationary impact on the US economy, and cause a reduction in supply of goods with a stationary demand for those goods, AKA inflation, and a reduction in overall freight as the US cannot produce the quantities of goods at a pace that is needed to keep up with demand in place of import reductions.\n\nPoint 2 - As stated before, Trump has no power over the Federal Reserve.  He may appoint a successor to the Chairmanship in 2026, and the nominee may be fiercely loyal to Trump. but the board members vote on monetary policy, and the Chairman cannot override a majority vote.  Trump only has control over Fiscal Policy, by increasing or reducing government spending in proposals that must be approved by Congress.  The executive branch cannot spend a dime without the funds being allocated by Congress into specific buckets, where what those buckets can purchase is dictated by federal law (the annual spending bills, not by executive discretion).\n\nPoint 3 - Deportations were higher under Biden than under Trump in his first term.  We will see what immigration policy will be once Trump takes office.  I'm not counting on immigration policy to impact trucking unless new identification and CDL rules are put into place by Congress.  After that, Congress must empower DOT to increase funding for enforcement.  Until changes happen to 49 CFR and new funding is made available for enforcement by DOT, or even by DHS.  Either way, Congress needs to act before the Executive can take steps to execute these policies.\n\nPoint 4 - I mostly agree with this, but it still requires Congress to increase funding to DOT and DHS to increase enforcement.  If a driver (illegal immigrant or US born citizen) is driving safely, maintaining their equipment properly, and is not acting suspicious, the odds of them getting pulled over for a random inspection is slim to none.  The only way this will work is if a nationwide network of checkpoints is established to do a level 3 inspection on every single truck crossing that checkpoint which is not only impractical, but no law enforcement agency has the staffing or funding to undertake such an effort.\n\nPoint 5 - I agree that there is a seasonal reduction in capacity as some carriers don't run in the winter.  This supports rate surges in the Pacific NW, mountains, midwest, and northeast.  The South will continue to see low rates, if not lower rates with carriers who stay running stay south to avoid the snow leading to excess capacity in these regions.",

I\u2019m aware and not afraid of the possibility of \u201cbullying.\u201d I\u2019ve been bullied my whole life and I hear no 90% of the time in all aspects of life.

I want to fully commit myself to this job. I\u2019m not afraid to work extra hours to get what I want.

I want to put in everything I have because why not me? what I\u2019m seeking by making this post is some experienced brokers who wouldn\u2019t mind me asking them questions and picking their brain, I love networking and connecting with others and all day I\u2019ve just been taking notes on cold calling and I\u2019m tired of it for the night. \n\nI want to turn the videos off and talk to real people in the industry. I would go on LinkedIn and spam connections but I\u2019m going to wait until it\u2019s closer to my start date so I can put my title on there, plus I\u2019m also waiting on a headshot so that\u2019s on the back burner. I plan on utilizing it heavily once I get it set up but I\u2019m not trying to overstep my bounds just yet. I\u2019m not trying to come off as entitled, I just want to grind.

        "content": "I've run exactly 3 loads for 3 letter 3PL. My authority is just under 3 months old. I was contacted directly this morning by 3PL, for a dedicated lane opportunity paying $4.59/mile one way, or $2.29/mile if I include DH back ($900 daily for under 200 miles, 26' box truck). M-F straight through. There's a third party company who will act as direct contact, I must contact them to provide photos of truck and ID and then if approved and I accept the contract, I must pay them a one time fee of my contract daily rate ($900). The 3PL rep called me from 3PLs number but refuses to send me an email to verify he works there. Can't get through to anyone by phone to verify he exists. Called the third party, in the email they sent me they spelled check as cheque and I cannot locate their website or phone number online. \n\nThe rate feels too high and the circumstances feel too weird, but they also sound legit at the same time. This would be a massive opportunity for me just starting out, if real. Any harm in sending these folks photos of my truck and driver license? Third party stated he can obtain my W9 and insurance from 3PL (I would think a fraudster would want that directly from me).\n\nIf it is legit, and I screw up the contract, what is the impact to my MC? Truck currently has engine light on, minor water leaks and slight odor from me trying to patch water leaks. They want a \"clean truck with no odor\". The third party mentioned something about it \"hurting my MC\" if I was unable to honor the contract. \n\nThanks in advance.",

I have worked for 2 more 3PLs and had a ~30x loads per day book. However, there is only so much you can learn/expand your career on with carrier sales. I wanted to learn the other side of the business, but without taking a step back to broker sales and starting a transferable book. I decided to start looking for direct shippers/vendors/freight forwarders to further grow my career.\n\nI have recently landed a job as a logistics analyst at a very big company that manages the supply chain for a fast food chain. I am now a couple of days into the position, and I cant help but feel overwhelmed. The interview process was very transparent, as far as me being honest with my resume and not sugar coating a ton of analytical experience, and I knew there would be a learning curve.\n\nThe biggest difference right off the bat is not having that daily hustle of trying to get the most books you can that day. Putting in the dials and books everyday is how I proved my work. I am inquiring about the previous analyst (left on his own accord) about what he did well and didnt do well from networking early on with everyone. Outside of that, I am not really sure my best avenue to be the best I can be in this position.\n\nAny advice/tips/experiences from being in a fast paced sales role to moving to an analyst role would be greatly appreciated.",

        "content": "Hey everyone, I could really use some advice. I\u2019m 20, and most of my work experience has been in food service, retail, face-to-face sales, and some eBay selling. Yesterday, I had an interview at the TQL office in Tampa (near Fletcher), and while I\u2019m really interested in getting into sales\u2014specifically as a broker\u2014I\u2019m not feeling too confident about how it went.\n\nSales in this area is new to me, and even though I passed all three tests with 100% during my second interview, I haven\u2019t heard back yet, which has me thinking I might have wasted my time, lol. Now, I\u2019m looking to explore other opportunities, but I don\u2019t know much about other companies in this field. I\u2019ve seen people on Reddit mention that some places are MLMs or \u201cdevil corps,\u201d which I\u2019d like to avoid. Maybe a 3PL would be a good option, but I don\u2019t know of any in my area.\n\nIf anyone has any recommendations for solid companies or advice on how to navigate this, I\u2019d really appreciate it. I\u2019m feeling a bit lost right now.",

        "content": "Hey guys, I am really new to the industry (1 year). I work for a 3PL in the US. I am technically a broker's assistant. The thing is that I receive tenders from his clients, I am in charge of building loads into the different systems we use. I also post loads in different systems like DAT to find carriers to cover those loads. I negotiate the rates with them, send them the rate con. Something I don't do is track the carriers, that is done by check callers who check their gps tracker and they do check calls also. But basically they report any problem or question to me and my boss. If the clients have any question or need help with anything, I take care of that if my boss is out of the office. I schedule also pickup and deliveries with the shippers and receivers by email or multiple TMS, I close loads after reviewing the PODs is good to go. And basically my boss and I do the same job in a daily basis. Something I don't do is find new clients, those are given to us by accounts manager and we just work with them once they get to an agreement with the company I work for. So can I put in my resume that I am basically a broker? Or is there something additional I need to learn in order to consider myself a broker? Cause being honest I feel like my boss and I do exactly the same thing. Except that he has more experience in the industry and I don't feel like he is willing to teach me, he just teach me the basic stuff in order to complete my daily tasks. ",

        "content": "From last year. First heard of this.\n\nC.H. Robinson announced September 11 that it had opened a new, 400,000-square-foot logistics facility in Laredo, Texas as the company expands its presence along the border of Mexico to 1.5 million square feet.\n\nAccording to Yahoo! Finance, the venue has been outfitted with 154 dock doors that can support up to 700 trailers at any given time, making it one of the largest cross-docking facilities in Laredo, Texas.\n\n\"It typically takes three trucks to bring a shipment through Laredo. A Mexico carrier brings the trailer to the border, a Mexico transfer carrier takes it across, then the freight is unloaded and reloaded onto a U.S. carrier\u2019s trailer,\" said Mike Burkhart, C.H. Robinson\u2019s vice president for Mexico. \"Because our cross-dock is significantly larger than most, has more dock doors than most and has dock doors on both sides, we can immediately unload freight when it arrives. It also reduces the reloading time, because forklift drivers don\u2019t have to crisscross the building. On a day when 350 loads are being picked up, if you reduce load time by an average of 10 minutes, that saves nearly 60 hours in one day.\"\n\nC.H. Robinson said that it manages over 1 million trucking, ocean, intermodal and air shipments annually at the Mexico-U.S. border.",

When an order is ready I send out quotes to my 3pl people and some direct carriers that I work with, they get back to me with a quote for the load, I choose the best one, I tell them, they send me a BOL. \n\nIn the last few months I've been bouncing around the idea of if I can just do this for myself? My role in the business is primarily sales and operations, I cold call companies to grow our business, and my business partner handles the finances. I spend a large chunk of my work day following up on freight quotes, etas, lost shipments, etc. \n\nI guess a question I have is, hypothetically, could I go get an entry level sales job with XPO or R&L or whoever, and then just pick up my own business as a customer and essentially ship all of our own freight at a lower rate? \n\nOr register as a broker, and start cold calling carriers to see if I can lower our own rates and maybe pick up some extra business ? \n\nOr to stop being stupid and not concern myself with any of this at all and just keep doing what we're doing ? Freight is a major cost for us and I would like to lower it, at the same time in my personal life I'm actually looking for another side gig to pass the time, my schedule is really flexible and I would like another job that's 100 percent commission that I can do during the day, so I was thinking this could kind of work since Im cold calling for my own company already anyway. \n\nAny advice is appreciated, thank you ",

Becoming a freight agent is an interesting take given the fact its your own freight but even that is probably not worth the hassle.\n\nThe best option for you is probably going to be to find more brokers (Wont be hard considering how many of us there are) and try and get a cheaper rate or see what YOU can do to make the loads cheaper. Examples of this are weight, good PU and delivery times, (Is your facility FCFS, are delivery appointments in the morning with quick unloads) etc. Those things can get the rate of your freight down a lot more as well. If your loads are easy to deal with and simple, you will get offered lower rates.",
