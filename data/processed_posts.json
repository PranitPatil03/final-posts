Stord is a shitshow, but may be a good fit for a smaller brand like yours. They just bought some excellent pitney bowes facilities. Pick a provider based on proximity to your average customer, tour the facility and ask lots of questions about their processes. Good luck!",

We use a basic in-house cloud system for management, which lacks features typical of modern warehouse and inventory software. This limitation puts pressure on our team as we deal with unnecessary daily issues. The corporate office can't replace the system since it's used by other locations. I'm considering integrating an API between our current system and a modern warehouse management solution to allow better communication and information reconciliation. Additionally, we have various unused equipment, such as Android handheld scanners and barcode printers, ordered by a previous employee, but they can't be integrated with our current system. I would appreciate any suggestions on how to address this and recommendations for effective warehouse management or inventory tracking software that could work with our equipment. Thank you!",

Sure, it's just time and money.  But you'll never be happy with the results.  And if corporate won't let you replace it, they'll certainly not let you overlay something new on top of it.",

Likewise you might connect subsystems on top of your WMS for controlling conveyors, voice picking etc.  If your base system is good enough, you could get someone in to assess and quote a voice system or similar to go on top.  All this tends to cost alot, so .. your scale and the size of the problem itself will determine whether it is worth the effort.  A half assed implementation is often worse than doing nothing.",

        "content": "Hello everyone! At Descartes, we\u2019ve been researching trends in home delivery and just completed our 2024 Home Delivery Sustainability Study. Given the shifts in logistics and the global economy, we examined how consumer preferences for sustainability impact last-mile delivery. 57% of consumers seek sustainable delivery options, and an impressive 99% are willing to take further steps to lower their carbon footprint. However, 89% indicated that economic factors like inflation influence their ability to pay more for eco-friendly delivery. Additionally, 37% now evaluate convenience and sustainability equally when selecting delivery methods. A significant trend is the emergence of green delivery slots, which consolidate multiple orders into fewer trips to decrease emissions and costs; 56% of respondents are open to this approach. For last-mile providers, this could be a vital innovation for both environmental benefits and better cost management. What are your thoughts? How is the last-mile sector adapting to sustainability goals amid cost challenges? Are there any new technologies or processes aiding you in balancing both? We\u2019d love to hear your insights! \ud83d\ude4c If you\u2019re interested in the complete study, you can find it here:",
