        "content": "Hello everyone, I recently joined a company as an assistant in the supply team. Our organization uses an in-house cloud system for management, but I find it quite basic and lacking features typical of modern warehouse/inventory management software. This has led to our team facing unnecessary daily challenges. The corporate office cannot replace the system since it's also in use at other locations. I\u2019m considering integrating an API between our in-house system and a modern warehouse management system to facilitate communication and data reconciliation. Additionally, we have various unused equipment, such as handheld mobile scanners, barcode printers, and wearable barcode scanners, which were ordered by a former employee but can't be integrated with our current system. I would appreciate suggestions on how to address this and recommendations for effective warehouse management/inventory tracking software to utilize our equipment. Thank you!",

You double your support effort, complicate troubleshooting, and have a completely non-standard interface.  You will also find that \"an API' will quickly turn into about 20 API's.  Could you do it?  Sure, it's just time and money.  But you'll never be happy with the results.  And if corporate won't let you replace it, they'll certainly not let you overlay something new on top of it.",

But it\u2019s crazy anyway and that\u2019s sounds more like you need to push for company wide change or in-house development of what you already have.",

Likewise you might connect subsystems on top of your WMS for controlling conveyors, voice picking etc.  If your base system is good enough, you could get someone in to assess and quote a voice system or similar to go on top.  All this tends to cost alot, so .. your scale and the size of the problem itself will determine whether it is worth the effort.  A half assed implementation is often worse than doing nothing.",

I can handle this, but my shipping rates with the post office are not competitive with a Canadian 3PL. I prefer to keep this service in-house since they are my clients. Is it common to send my clients' inventory to a 3PL and then bill them for the cost, similar to a white label arrangement? One client, in particular, has about 200 units per month.

Here are my considerations: 1. Time - A master's typically takes 2 years, while certifications/trainings take about 3-6 months. 2. Program Type: Master's in Engineering Management, SCM, or Finance; Certifications in Six Sigma Green/Black Belt, Data Analytics & Business Intelligence, or Demand Planning/Forecasting. 3.

        "content": "Hello everyone! At Descartes, we've been examining trends in home delivery and just completed our 2024 Home Delivery Sustainability Study. Given the current logistics landscape and global economy, we investigated how consumer sustainability preferences impact last-mile delivery. Notably, 57% of consumers are interested in sustainable options, and 99% are willing to take further steps to lower their carbon footprint. However, 89% indicated that economic factors, like inflation, influence their ability to pay more for eco-friendly delivery. Additionally, 37% consider convenience and sustainability equally when selecting delivery options. A significant trend is the emergence of green delivery slots, which bundle multiple orders into fewer trips to lower emissions and costs, with 56% of respondents willing to adopt this practice. For last-mile providers, this could be a vital innovation for improving environmental impact and managing costs. What are your thoughts? How is the last-mile sector adapting to achieve sustainability while facing cost challenges? Are there new technologies or processes helping you find this balance? I'd love to hear your insights! \ud83d\ude4c If you're interested in exploring the full study, you can find it here:",
