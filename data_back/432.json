  "title": "Looking for a US T86 entry broker for ecommerce goods entering by truck from Canada",
  "content": "Hi r/Logistics, I'm consulting for an organization seeking a US customs broker to manage T86 entries for ecommerce goods transported by truck across the northern border. They process about 5,000 entries daily, increasing during peak times, and ship six days a week year-round. While only a portion of these entries is available for this opportunity, it is a permanent role, and the share of T86 entries is expected to grow as US regulations tighten. The organization is an experienced ecommerce 3PL with a stable client and commodity base, holding all necessary FDA, Health Canada, and other licenses. They handle a mix of regulated and non-regulated products like food, dietary supplements, and consumer goods, primarily from the US, Canada, or China. Current clearance methods include S321, T86, and both informal and formal entries. They seek competitive pricing from a broker experienced in ecommerce who can manage bulk entry submissions via Excel or API/EDI. The commodities are stable, consisting of well-known brands with long product cycles, not from a marketplace. The goal is to launch ASAP, potentially starting next week with the right partner. They are interested only in brokers experienced with ecommerce T86, and future daily trucking opportunities may arise depending on the partner. This could be a multi-million dollar annual account for a suitable brokerage or forwarder. DM me for more details if you think you can help.",

We sold everything in 2022, and I took an accounting manager position at a 3PL company that operates four warehouses along the East Coast and has a trucking division mainly focused on transporting containers from ports to our warehouses.

Although I'm skilled in accounting, I don’t enjoy it and don’t see a future at my current small company.

However, my job applications haven't been successful lately. Recently, I secured an interview for a buyer position at a major food distributor in the Philly area. I seek advice on how to present my experience for this role, as I feel slightly overqualified but hope to grow in a large company.

To really understand everything you want to know, you really do need a degree; you're not going to learn statistics and stochastic simulation and newsvendor models and all the other necessary context from just one course. \n\nHowever, if you only had to understand one thing, you would need to understand how to calculate a re-order point and how to work with that.\n\nIf you're not an expert in data science/forecasting/ML/statistics, you would want to get with someone who is (i.e. in the planning team), and then get them to design a solution to calculate your re-order point (\"ROP\").  That is the minimum \"floor\" of inventory you have, at which point you trigger a replenishment order.\n\nIf your lead time for replenishment (i.e. the time between the point at which you press the \"re-order\" button and the time you receive that replenishment order) is short, then you are in luck and you might be able to greatly simplify this.  If your lead time for replenishment is lengthy or highly variable, you would generally want to use a stochastic simulation to calculate your \"optimal inventory level\" for a *specific product*, which is what you said you wanted to know how to do.\n\nThe way you want to set a re-order point is to calculate the joint conditional probability distribution of the lead time and the demand forecast, and then optimize that according to your desired \"Cycle Service Level\" or CSL.  If your CSL is 90%, then you are trying to set an inventory level that will permit you to remain in stock on that product at least 90% of the time.  You can play with the value to be more or less aggressive.\n\nSkipping over a lot of other details here — you should lean on your planning and forecasting team about these — once you have an optimal ROP for each Sku of interest, then you trigger a replenishment order whenever you are at or below the ROP (or close to it).  This is how you manage.\n\nActually implementing this in practice is non-trivial to do, but it can be done.  I have done this for my small wine importing company.  We have long and highly variable lead times and highly seasonal demand for our core products, so the ROP changes as we move through time, according to seasonality.  Honestly, it's easier to manage these things when you can just do it all yourself sometimes — otherwise you need to coordinate the efforts of a large team, which can sometimes be costly and can eat up budget if you're not careful.",

After that, you need to decide how many days or weeks you feel comfortable having on hand. If you have a high moving item or material that you know has 2 week lead time, then having 3 weeks of inventory might not hurt you. \n\nLook at your suppliers reliability as well. If they’re always shipping on time and in full then you can asume you’ll be ok should you run a bit lean during a peak period or promotion. However, if they’re shorting you and have supply issues, you know to stock up a bit. Safety stock levels will be more important here.",

Google it and you should find a vendor in your country. The main thing with glass packaging is to make sure it is wrapped with a material that is spongy enough (not very stiff paper) to absorb impact but stiff enough to hold the jar in place inside the box. So if you’re using paper bubble wrap, make sure its outer packaging is not loose - like a courier poly bag. It should be a box and the wrapping should be enough that it fits firmly inside the box without moving about.",

We use a basic in-house cloud system for management, but it lacks the features of modern warehouse and inventory software. This has led to our team facing unnecessary daily challenges. The corporate office can't replace the system since it's used in other locations. I’m considering integrating an API between our in-house system and a modern warehouse management system to facilitate communication and data reconciliation. Additionally, we have equipment like handheld Android scanners, barcode printers, and wearable scanners that a previous employee ordered but never used due to integration issues. I would appreciate any suggestions on how to address this and recommendations for effective warehouse management/inventory tracking software that can work with our equipment. Thank you!",

Please email me if you can assist or refer me to someone who can! \n\nHere's a brief overview of our company: Runtime.gg is a German nutrition firm launching an e-commerce store in the U.S. and looking into fulfillment services. We will start with 40-50 SKUs, with an average order containing 60% of 1-3 SKUs, 35% of 3-5 SKUs, and 5% of 5+ SKUs. Our current volume in Germany exceeds 4,500 orders per month, and we expect similar volume in the U.S. The average dimensions for our most commonly used box are 26cm x 23cm x 15.5cm, with average order weights between 1.05kg and 1.8kg (4lb-13lb).

  "content": "Hello everyone! At Descartes, we've been examining trends in home delivery and have completed our 2024 Home Delivery Sustainability Study. Given the developments in logistics and the global economy, we wanted to investigate how consumer preferences for sustainability impact last-mile delivery. 57% of consumers are interested in sustainable delivery options, and an impressive 99% are willing to take further steps to lower their carbon footprint. However, 89% mentioned that economic factors, such as inflation, influence their ability to pay more for eco-friendly delivery. Notably, 37% now consider convenience and sustainability equally important when selecting delivery methods. A significant trend is the emergence of green delivery slots, which bundle multiple orders into fewer trips to reduce emissions and costs, with 56% of respondents open to this approach. This could be a crucial innovation for last-mile providers to support environmental efforts while effectively managing costs. What are your thoughts? How is the last-mile sector adapting to achieve sustainability goals amid cost challenges? Are there new technologies or processes helping you find this balance? I’d love to hear your insights! 🙌 If you want to explore the full study, you can find it here:",

  "content": "I wanted to share my logistics experience to assist those exploring this career. I've worked on both the 3PL/freight brokerage side and the customer side, and it's been quite a journey. As an account coordinator at a 3PL, the workload is intense, with overwhelming emails and last-minute issues. Larger 3PLs provide some work-life balance by having specific teams manage after-hours problems, while smaller brokerages expect near-constant availability. I earned about $64K, but the stress and off-hours calls were draining. On the customer side, being a logistics specialist is less intense. In smaller companies, the workload was manageable, and I rarely worked late or outside regular hours, but the pay was lower, around $45-$55K. Although the role is more relaxed, it falls short of my $100K salary goal without moving into rare managerial roles. I also explored customs clearance, which involves constant updates and issues but offers little financial improvement. Overall, logistics is a challenging, undervalued field, and the pay reflects that. It’s tough to find well-paying roles without excessive hours. For those considering this field, be mindful of its demands and limited financial rewards.",

We have a warehouse at our new office where we store inventory for our maintenance and HVAC teams, including appliances for unit upgrades and turns. Currently, we lack an inventory management system; we only have a person using a spreadsheet, which doesn’t track who takes items or their whereabouts. I want to implement a QR-based system that allows items to be scanned out of the warehouse (indicating who took them and removing them from 'warehouse inventory') and scanned in at the property (adding to the property's 'in-use inventory'). Each maintenance team member should have individual access to link inventory to them. I also want to generate inventory reports to inform our purchasing agent about our needs. I'm unsure if QR is the best option, but it emerged from our brainstorming. I believe something similar exists, but I'm struggling to find solutions that aren't retail-focused or overloaded with unnecessary work order features, as those are managed in our PMS. Any guidance would be appreciated! Thanks!",

In your case the additional feature would be to affect the count of the various parts that are associated with the product.

  "content": "Hello everyone, \n\nWe're currently using Shopify for inventory management, which works well for processing credit card transactions and POS sales. However, it has its limitations. While it handles media like e-commerce software, it doesn't meet my team's needs. We require quick access to product listings and associated images based on the DBA. For instance, when a client inquires about a product, finding details and photos in Shopify without knowing the SKU is time-consuming, and downloading images on mobile is nearly impossible. We need a system that better manages media and simplifies data handling. We’ve considered using a CMS like Strapi, Contentful, or Payload to manage everything and then sync it with Shopify. Any suggestions? I’m open to a paid discussion for a more detailed implementation solution, but I’d like to gather initial thoughts first.",

  "title": "Attempted Theft and Carrier411 Fraud?",
  "content": "I had nearly three years without fraud issues, which I took pride in. However, I recently let my guard down and faced a situation involving freight theft, though I managed to prevent it before any significant consequences arose. Unfortunately, a reputable carrier became a victim of a fraudulent FreightGuard report on Carrier411, damaging their business. Here's the account with evidence: We had a reefer load from NE to TX, and my operations guy received a call from VOKHID TRANSPORTATION (MC 1226568 DOT 3573700). They provided the driver's name, phone number, truck, and trailer, all necessary for check-in at the shipper. Although something felt off, the driver accepted tracking, and my ops guy confirmed the ETA. The driver checked in at the shipper (drop trailer) but faced delays. The next morning, when he tried to retrieve the trailer, there was confusion over the trailer number, raising suspicions. However, since the truck and driver matched, I decided to monitor the situation closely. An hour later, I noticed the truck heading West instead of South and called the driver. During our conversation, I discovered the driver wasn't affiliated with GOSMART, and the dispatcher had received a rate confirmation from THOR XPRESS 3PL (MC 601820), which was a victim of identity theft. I spoke with someone there to confirm my findings and provided documentation to help them resolve the issue. The driver also received a call from a fraudster impersonating Thor Xpress, claiming the load had changed to deliver to Target in Fontana, CA, with cash payment at delivery. After some questioning, he provided the company name JDS Trans (MC 870454). I contacted JDS Trans, informed them of the situation, and they sent over documentation from the fraudster, enabling us to set them on the right path. We prevented the load theft, but soon after, they received a FreightGuard report from ACE TRUCKLOAD, LLC, attributed to a Jane Watson, claiming they had stolen freight and requested payment. The report included a non-working number and another that led to someone who couldn't confirm Jane Watson's existence. After following up with ACE Truckload, I learned they had the report removed, suspecting their Carrier411 account was hacked. I emailed the address on the report but haven't received a response. Notably, the fraudster had been posting the load on DAT since 10/28, before our load was posted",

They have about 5,000 entries daily, with peaks during busy periods, shipping six days a week year-round. Although only a portion of these daily entries are available for this opportunity, it is a permanent role, and the percentage of T86 entries is expected to rise with increasing US regulations. The client is an established e-commerce 3PL with a solid client and commodity base, holding all necessary FDA, Health Canada, and other licenses. They deal with a mix of regulated and non-regulated products, including food, dietary supplements, and household goods, primarily from the US, Canada, or China. Current entries are processed using S321, T86, informal, and formal methods as needed. They seek competitive pricing from a broker experienced in e-commerce who can manage bulk entry submissions via Excel template uploads or API/EDI. The commodities are stable, featuring well-known brands with long product lifecycles, and are not from a marketplace. These are de minimis imports of the same product, delivered to different consignees daily. They aim to launch ASAP, potentially starting as soon as next week if they find the right partner. They prefer to engage only with brokers experienced in e-commerce T86. Future daily trucking opportunities may arise depending on the partner. This could be a multi-million dollar annual account for the right brokerage or forwarder. Please DM me for more details if you believe you have a solution.",

The advantages would include seamless onboarding, nearby support, and access to our carrier rates, though we wouldn't manage daily operations.

However, the logistics have become too burdensome, as we ship 100-500 packages monthly, averaging 12in x 12in and 2lbs each. We typically order gifts from platforms like Amazon and Etsy.

Once you get that done it runs smooth, things happen but as long as you plan and prepare you should be fine. If you don't do anything, that's when the stress happens. \n\nAutomate as much as you can and look at the process constantly to see how you can simplify it. \n\nI use Chat GPT and other AI programs hourly to make adjustments. \n\nCarriers will respond to you if you threaten to take the work if they aren't doing it to the level you need.

If you designate 30 min time periods throughout the day for different task, you will find that you can dip into the most major parts of your AOR each day. You have to stick with it. If something urgent comes up and requires your immediate attention (always, I  know) then do it and return to your task window of time. \n\n2. Those of us that are diligent tend to take things personally when they don’t go as planned. If there are things not under your direct control, let that shit go. I took all failures of other people and it ate me up. I’m speaking mainly of internal operations like sales or finance. If it’s a vendor making your life miserable, replace them. If it employees that report to you, replace them. But let what you can’t fully control go.",

You know what will take 10 minutes and what will take 2 hours, not the person on the other end of the phone/email.\n\n\nPersonally, I start the day and bang out the quick tasks first. Then move onto the more detailed requests, and towards the end of the day start on the newest requests. \n\n\nI do get pulled away from this plan throughout the day to handle truly urgent and time sensitive items and that's ok. Handle that and then get back to the plan you made at the start of the day. \n\n\nAs other commentors have said, this is all about time management in the end and having an understanding of your abilities and your company and customers needs overall will help you navigate each day.

While SHero is comprehensive, it isn't cheap, so I'd hesitate to recommend it to someone just starting a 3PL.\n\nCurrently, we're exploring alternatives to SHero for various reasons (happy to discuss privately). Some options we've looked into include:\n\n* Warehance: A really solid and more affordable solution started by my friend who also used to use SHero\n* Packiyo: Created by an ex-SHero founder, seems fairly solid but lacked some features we needed\n* Logiwa: Another established option in the space\n\nWe've been moving over to Warehance and it's been working out really well for us.

Most importantly the customer service is awesome which is what you want from your WMS provider:\n\nHowever, I see that a lot of new merchants are also getting into starting prep businesses or starter 3PL businesses like yourself. Hopstacks main platform is prolly an overkill. So they have another product that was launched a while ago called Ignite that focusses on starter businesses. I’ll highly recommend that. The alternatives that I have tried like scanpower, prepshiphub haven’t been that great for my clients.\n\nYou can also stitch something together with excel and airtable, but the effort involved might not be worth your time.

  "content": "I currently work in operations at an asset-based 3PL company, primarily acting as a dispatcher for our drivers and managing our freight brokerage alone. I'm feeling burnt out from the chaos of both asset-based operations and brokerage, especially since my company won't hire additional help as we grow, and management seems stuck in outdated practices. While freight isn't our main focus, as we mainly distribute our own products, I often feel like an afterthought and am expected to quickly secure trucks for outbound shipments. It's challenging to maintain enough drivers while also allowing flexibility during slow outbound periods. Although this role is what I was hired for, I'm exhausted from constantly resolving issues with customers and managing drivers. I believe I could thrive in TMS software sales or support, leveraging my transportation knowledge without the daily shipment involvement. Has anyone successfully moved from operations to a logistics-related role? If so, what are you doing now, and are you financially doing well?",

All my workers are temp, and the stress from peak season and the new customer's YMS leads to frequent training of new hires, which has become overwhelming.

I work three 12-hour shifts (Friday to Sunday) and often take work home, coming in during the week to help. This week, I’ve felt close to quitting each day as I manage errors across all shifts while running my own operation.

  "content": "Hello everyone, I'm new to ecommerce and plan to launch my brand in a few months. We've selected suppliers from Asia, mainly China and Korea, but I'm unsure about shipment fees. I've requested DDP shipping costs from these suppliers, yet since we're receiving multiple cartons from different locations, I believe it would be more cost-effective to consolidate shipments through a single Freight Forwarder in one city. This way, we can reduce shipping costs before sending them to our 3PL, which also charges fees per pallet or carton. I've contacted several Freight Forwarders on Alibaba, in China, and in Australia, but their rates vary significantly. For a consolidated shipment of 200kg, I'm seeing quotes ranging from $1 to $10/kg, with some quotes reaching up to $2000. The $10/kg seems excessive, especially since individual shipments are cheaper. I've been advised to choose Freight Forwarders based where I am located rather than where I'm importing from. Should I opt for Chinese or Australian Freight Forwarders? If I select those from Alibaba, how can I ensure their legitimacy? Would using trade assurance and high reviews provide sufficient security?",

If your shipment consists of general goods, most freight forwarders in China can offer similar rates. In this case, whether your forwarder has a warehouse in China to consolidate your shipments becomes a key factor (as you've correctly understood, shipping larger volumes in one go generally leads to lower rates).  \n  \n2. Many people may suggest using a local forwarder, but the biggest drawback is often the lack of competition, leading to higher prices. In fact, local forwarders often collaborate with Chinese forwarders, simply earning a markup on top of the original rates.  \n  \n3. This is where Alibaba Trade Assurance comes in. By using this service, your payment is only released to the forwarder once you've received and confirmed the shipment. If any issues arise during transit that prevent you from receiving your goods, you can open a case and claim your shipping fees back.",

I've worked at two additional 3PLs with a daily load book of about 30. However, I felt limited in growth within carrier sales and wanted to explore the other side of the business without reverting to broker sales. So, I began seeking direct shippers, vendors, and freight forwarders to advance my career. I recently secured a position as a logistics analyst at a large company that manages the supply chain for a fast food chain. A few days into the role, I feel overwhelmed. The interview process was straightforward, and I was honest about my resume and lack of extensive analytical experience, anticipating a learning curve. The most noticeable change is the absence of the daily hustle to maximize load books, which previously validated my work. I'm reaching out to the former analyst for insights on his networking successes and challenges. Beyond that, I'm unsure how to excel in this new position, so any advice or shared experiences transitioning from a fast-paced sales role to an analyst role would be greatly appreciated.",

  "title": "key differences in services between ocean carriers and forwarders",
  "content": "Forwarders often become solely freight brokers, acting as intermediaries between ocean carriers and shippers, which limits their services—especially when shippers use CIF or FOB terms that minimize their responsibility at the port of discharge, transferring it to the consignee. To stand out, global freight forwarders, especially new entrants in overseas markets, need to differentiate their services from those of ocean carriers like Maersk, Evergreen, CMA-CGM, and MSC. This will allow them to offer added value rather than just sell ocean carrier services, a market that is already saturated and challenging for profit.",

Amazon fulfillment fully reimburses for product losses if you know how to run reports and engage with customer support. The larger 3PLs I've worked with, likely private equity-backed, always issue refunds per the service agreement without issues. With smaller 3PLs, usually 75,000 to 200,000 square feet and operated by single small businesses, what is a reasonable loss and reimbursement rate? Previously, the loss rate was 0.1% (1 in 1000 units), and we handle bulky small appliance items. A 1% loss rate seems excessive.",

  "content": "I work for a home appliances company that employs contracted 3PL (third-party logistics) providers for daily deliveries to dealers. All orders are pre-scheduled. For instance, if the sales department confirms a delivery of 50 TVs for tomorrow, the 3PL will deliver them during business hours the next day. One policy of our 3PL is that drivers do not call recipients before deliveries; they arrive and request to unload. I've learned the reasons behind this: deliveries are pre-scheduled, so recipients should be prepared at any time during the day; drivers have multiple stops, and calling may lead to specific timing requests that disrupt their routes; and reducing calls helps cut costs for the 3PL. However, I’m uncertain if this is standard for all 3PL providers. This approach frustrates me because the sales team often asks for ETAs, and I can only advise them that if a delivery is scheduled for today, recipients should be prepared at any time. The sales team believes this practice is irresponsible and harms customer experience.",

Upon delivery, my customer, who was present at both pickup and delivery, noticed the carrier had switched trailers without notifying us. During cross-docking, a part of a high-value machine was damaged. I had clearly instructed the carrier's dispatcher at booking that any truck or trailer changes must be communicated in advance, and the rate confirmation stated that unapproved changes would lead to non-payment. As the customer’s claim process will begin soon, I seek advice on whether I should deduct the carrier’s payment due to their non-compliance and the damages.

I just broke away from 2 decades in brokerage to go to the customer side.  It took me more than a year to find a role that matched my needs.  It's hard to escape the \"freight bro\" label once you get it.  However,  brokerage roles definitely start at more than minimum wage.  A lot of brokerage sales roles start at 55k a year plus commission.",

I'm looking to distribute a hand cream in 150ml tubs to get started. Packages under 1kg are really cheap to send. I'll be incorporating the delivery cost into my sale price (will provide free shipping), so the cost of delivery matters a lot to me. Storage was also very cheap. They charge for the first pick where others seem to offer the first for free.\n\nThey have a center in Germany close to the France border. I'm also outside of the EU and Germany seems to be the best option, for logistics and also setting up for VAT. \n\nI do have a small reservation with Fulfillment Box as their email communication for the sales has been difficult... I'm hoping its not a sign of things to come. They tell me that once a contract is signed they set up a Telegram chat with the team assigned to the project. \n\nIf you get in contact with them I'd be really interested to hear your thoughts! As I'm in the process of signing on with them but not locked in yet.\n\nThe other two I was considering were Octopia and Huboo. Huboo has a 375 Euro minimum spend per month, Octopia had more expensive storage but a free first pick",

I feel sorry for the bias surrounding this issue, as those researching parcel delivery options encounter mostly one-sided information. This likely stems from the fact that 99% of well-delivered packages go unreported since customers have no reason to complain. In summary, researching the performance of parcel services, particularly international ones, provides little useful information.",

  "title": "Career Growth for Freight Broker? ",
  "content": "I have spent the last ten years in logistics, beginning as a bike messenger at a courier company in 2014. I progressed through various office roles, including dispatch, operations management, business development, and account management, gaining experience in Ops/Sales for both asset-based and 3PL networks, covering services like expedited parcel, LTL, and air cargo. Working at a smaller company with around 30 office staff and 100 drivers made me feel significant in my role. After reaching a plateau at the courier company, I pursued an associate degree and advanced certification in Supply Chain Management & Logistics in 2020, graduating in 2022. I then became an Account Manager at a midsized Freight Brokerage, focusing on customer relations in a split model brokerage. However, following our acquisition by a larger firm, I experienced a disillusioning environment marked by frequent policy changes, high turnover, and cultural clashes. While I perform well, I now feel like a “smaller fish in a bigger pond.” Despite my success, I am burned out trying to establish myself as a newer freight broker in a challenging market, working over 50 hours a week without clear opportunities for growth or adequate compensation (around $70k). Job openings at my company are scarce, and I am considering exploring roles outside logistics. I excel at spreadsheets and data analysis (having an advanced Excel certification) and am interested in automation/AI, believing I’d thrive in analyst or purchasing roles. Although I have succeeded in sales and management, I’m not keen on returning to management. Living in Chicago’s Southside, I prefer remote work but am open to hybrid or in-person roles, aiming to maintain a salary of at least $70k. My community college certification followed the ASCM syllabus, and while I’ve considered pursuing a CLDT or CSCP, I’m uncertain about their relevance to my current situation. I would appreciate your insights on potential roles, industries, or companies that align with my skills and experience.",

Mostly you have to find ways to safely and effectivily optimize the space you have, and what works this year might not next. Likely you'll have an agreed rate system, and you're competing with established companies whom found ways to already by competitive. Your cost directly relates to the small Ecomm's cost per shipment, and they can't be competitive if you're not affordable and reliable. Clients will come and go, and if you're going after small clients this will be often.  \n  \n2. Things go wrong. Often. Employees call off, carriers don't show up, power outages, leak in roof, internet outages, equipment breaks, safety incidents, theft, damages and those are just issues on your side. Clients will also have their own problems they will expect you to fix, it's a relationship and it's not passive.  \n  \n3. Being a 3PL isn't always about being directly profitable. Many companies leverage their 3PL business as a VAS on a small margin to effectively win more lucrative freight contracts. 3PLs also aren't about being the cheapest, in most cases it's a balance of quality, reliability, and cost like any business. It also takes a lot of people, infrastructure and intervention to keep things going.  \n  \nIf you want passive, you are better off doing the EComm side on something non-propiertary resale instead of the distribution side.",

However, I struggle to connect with new potential clients, possibly due to a cultural issue. When people hear \"AI,\" they often dismiss it as too expensive, even though we offer competitive pricing. Additionally, identifying key decision-makers in companies is challenging; CEOs are usually too busy, and operations managers often lack the authority and are hesitant to disrupt existing processes. Any suggestions on how to approach this?",

Did you speak to the prospective customers before building it? And did they tell you that the reason they hate the existing system is because its not good and slow and that they will pay you and switch to your solution if you build it better and faster? If yes, then go back to those prospects and sell them the solution now that it's ready. Build a case study once it gets implemented on how its solving the problem better and in cost effective way. Show tangible savings. Publish the case study. Showcase it in transportation conferences/events and build the deal pipeline from there.",

This is both for incoming POs to receive inventory along with the outbound customer orders.\n\nYou may want to first investigate something like a marketplace solution.  For example, both Amazon and Walmart offer services where they'll warehouse your product and process orders transmitted from your website.  Fulfillment by Amazon and Walmart Fulfillment Services will store your inventory in their facilities and process orders from your website.\n\nUltimately, you have to be comfortable with the decision.

  "content": "I had two air shipments to collect in Miami for a customer: AWB A with 7 skids and AWB B with 3 skids. Both were picked up from the same warehouse and delivered to the same client. The pickup occurred last Wednesday via a transport company I've used frequently, with delivery on Thursday and a POD received by Monday morning. However, my customer emailed at noon saying not all goods were received. After some discussion, the trucking company informed me that the warehouse only loaded the 7 skids for AWB B onto the truck, claiming that the driver presented both AWBs. The trucking company blames the warehouse for not loading the correct pallets, while the warehouse is unresponsive. Since I live across the country, I can't verify the loading. Whose responsibility is this: the trucking company, the warehouse, or neither? Additionally, I might be misusing terms; the trucking company operates as a logistics provider that contracts smaller carriers. Is that considered a brokerage, logistics, or 3PL?",

EDIT 2: We need a Texas-based 3PL that integrates with our Shopify store, updates and scans inventory, inspects deliveries, manages RMAs, and ships via LTL and UPS. Thanks!",

      "body": "I was once in your position of finding a 3PL company for our US company. Let me share you the steps I made. \n\n1. Decide on which location you want your warehouse to be in. Remember, you will be having a physical nexus in that state so be familiar with the sales tax in that state. You also need to register in that state. \n\n2. Search and search. Google, reddit, youtube. I also fill up some forms in 3PL finders like Fulfill.com. They are very responsive and gave good leads. This is also one of the reason why I joined this subreddit even if I am not a logistics person. Well, you need to wear many hats in a start-up. \n\nAnother trick I made is to find the nearest Port (say, in Texas) in Google maps. Search for 3PL and it will show you the 3PLs in the area. “Walk” around the area near the port going further and reach out to the companies you see in the map. \n\n3. Track all the companies you reached out to. Sometimes they don’t respond immediately. This way, you can do follow ups on them. It is difficult to find a 3PL that can cater to large and heavy items. Most of them prefer high volume (in terms of orders), low value goods. \n\nOr, you just want to know where are you in the quotation stage. \n\n4. Give a deadline for this process. Tell the prospects when is your goal to start the partnership. Give specific date. Sometimes they cannot accommodate you and that’s alright. Note it in your tracker. You might need them in the future. \n\n5. Get your numbers ready. You will be answering a lot of questions from prospective 3PL companies. You may encounter logistics jargons. Ask google or chatgpt or the 3PL company if you have questions. \n\nUsual questions are number of orders in a month, storage requirements, qty of inbound supplies, last mile delivery requirements, etc. They are a lot. \n\n6. Once you receive all quotes, do sample computation in order to compare apples to apples. Now you are done in quantitative part. Next, qualitative. \n\n7. Search for reviews in the internet. Ask reddit. \n\nGo back to your impressions during the meeting or while conversing with them via email. Are they responsive or dismissive? Do they offer something that could lead to another service that you might need in the future? \n\nAsk qualitative questions. What is their order accuracy guarantee, communication preferences, return guidelines, etc. \n\n8. Combine both quantitative and qualitative items you get from them then decide on which one to get. \n\nThese are a lot but I don’t think I was able to put them all here. If you have more questions, reply here or message me. \n\nI used the steps above in finding our two 3PL partners in the US and recently, in Canada. Next goal is the EU or maybe UAE—depends on the management’s directive. \n\nI am part of an e-com brand too and this is my experience when I expanded my role to the logistics.\n\nAnother note, if you are a small to medium company, it is best to stick with small to medium 3PLs. Famous and large 3PL companies don’t really prioritize small ecom businesses. Our experience with them is not good.",

While this needs to account for warehouse and other expenses, I would be surprised if most costs in 3PL weren't personnel-related, making that figure still seem high.",

Open to buy, realistic budgets etc are a civilians bread and butter. I know the military transition teams pump us all full of “corporate America is dying for your leadership” but they aren’t. They want someone who knows how to win in their environment. They want someone coming from a big name company that will give them and their team a warm and fuzzy that they know how to win. The military is just too foreign for them to understand. Look for some individual contributor roles, get that civilian experience and then flex to the manager roles.",

We get a percentage of the gross profit on each shipment, usually around 10-15%, with no draw. We don't have to worry about losses coming out of our pockets, but the earning potential is definitely lower than what you're describing.\n\nI'm curious, how do you manage the stress of potential losses? Do you have any strategies for minimizing risk?\n\nI've also been wondering if it's worth switching to a company with a higher commission structure.

  "content": "Hello everyone! I run a furniture e-commerce brand on Shopify (Hoek Home) and we ship furniture within the US. Recently, we noticed a significant increase in UPS shipping costs for our Dining Table (box dimensions: 63 x 33 x 3 - 49lbs). Has anyone else experienced this? I contacted UPS, but they claim there haven't been any changes on their end. We're using the same package, weight, and dimensions, yet prices have risen by 60% since last week. Is anyone facing this issue? Any suggestions for carriers for bulky items? We can't fully switch to 3PL yet since we need to inspect and test each unit before shipping, so we require a carrier that can deliver like UPS. Thanks!",

  "content": "I’m assisting a friend, a Mexican citizen visiting Canada as a tourist, who bought a 2007 GMC C5500 diesel flatbed truck with automatic transmission and 177,500 km for $15,000 CAD in Hamilton, Ontario. He has the green slip ownership and is aware of the associated freight, taxes, and fees but is unaware of the complexities involved in shipping and importing a commercial vehicle to Mexico. He seeks a company to manage the entire process, ideally delivering the truck to Manzanillo, Colima, a key cargo port near Puerto Vallarta. Returning or selling the vehicle isn't an option; he is determined to ship it but needs guidance. He’s considering: 1. Finding a local company in Hamilton/Toronto/Niagara to handle everything. 2. Shipping from a Canadian port, like Halifax or Quebec/Montreal, which would require further transport to the Pacific coast. 3. Driving the truck into the U.S. (e.g., New York State) for an American company to pick it up, though he wants to avoid driving it across the U.S. and Mexico. He is looking for recommendations on the best approach or freight companies that specialize in this type of shipment. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

To really understand everything you want to know, you really do need a degree; you're not going to learn statistics and stochastic simulation and newsvendor models and all the other necessary context from just one course. \n\nHowever, if you only had to understand one thing, you would need to understand how to calculate a re-order point and how to work with that.\n\nIf you're not an expert in data science/forecasting/ML/statistics, you would want to get with someone who is (i.e. in the planning team), and then get them to design a solution to calculate your re-order point (\"ROP\").  That is the minimum \"floor\" of inventory you have, at which point you trigger a replenishment order.\n\nIf your lead time for replenishment (i.e. the time between the point at which you press the \"re-order\" button and the time you receive that replenishment order) is short, then you are in luck and you might be able to greatly simplify this.  If your lead time for replenishment is lengthy or highly variable, you would generally want to use a stochastic simulation to calculate your \"optimal inventory level\" for a *specific product*, which is what you said you wanted to know how to do.\n\nThe way you want to set a re-order point is to calculate the joint conditional probability distribution of the lead time and the demand forecast, and then optimize that according to your desired \"Cycle Service Level\" or CSL.  If your CSL is 90%, then you are trying to set an inventory level that will permit you to remain in stock on that product at least 90% of the time.  You can play with the value to be more or less aggressive.\n\nSkipping over a lot of other details here — you should lean on your planning and forecasting team about these — once you have an optimal ROP for each Sku of interest, then you trigger a replenishment order whenever you are at or below the ROP (or close to it).  This is how you manage.\n\nActually implementing this in practice is non-trivial to do, but it can be done.  I have done this for my small wine importing company.  We have long and highly variable lead times and highly seasonal demand for our core products, so the ROP changes as we move through time, according to seasonality.  Honestly, it's easier to manage these things when you can just do it all yourself sometimes — otherwise you need to coordinate the efforts of a large team, which can sometimes be costly and can eat up budget if you're not careful.",

After that, you need to decide how many days or weeks you feel comfortable having on hand. If you have a high moving item or material that you know has 2 week lead time, then having 3 weeks of inventory might not hurt you. \n\nLook at your suppliers reliability as well. If they’re always shipping on time and in full then you can asume you’ll be ok should you run a bit lean during a peak period or promotion. However, if they’re shorting you and have supply issues, you know to stock up a bit. Safety stock levels will be more important here.",

  "content": "Hi everyone, I'm 37 and thinking about transitioning to a full career in Supply Chain Management, but I’m concerned about being too old for this change. I'm curious if the industry holds any age-related biases in hiring, especially for positions where I might compete with younger candidates who have recent degrees or training. As for my background, I have substantial experience in logistics and shipping both domestically and internationally. I’ve consulted for companies, focusing on reducing shipping costs, resolving software issues, and managing daily operations. I’ve also handled packaging and quality control for significant projects, such as awards for the NBA, overseeing complex shipping operations, including 3PL solutions and customs filings. My worry is whether entering a structured supply chain role at 37 might disadvantage me. Would companies consider hiring someone my age with a relevant but non-traditional background? Additionally, I plan to transfer to Arizona State University next spring to apply for the SCM program. I’d appreciate any insights on this. Thank you!",

Supply Chain, in my opinion, is one of the more thankless careers. That said, you can really connect with other folks in our industry and a lot of the relationships from Supplier - Customer (B2B) are super enjoyable for me. We all know we are going to deal with some form of BS at least weekly and its that grit and understanding that makes it enjoyable for me. \n\nOn a side note - F sales and operations lol I only kid, all roles in manufacturing and business are necessary just find an org that at least tries to work together cross functionally",

Can you recommend good resources to learn about purchasing? I noticed ASCM offers a procurement certification, but will it teach me anything beyond what CPIM covers?",

I think taking your business in a more strategic direction would be beneficial (ex: analyzing what buckets make up your largest spend, and how to drive those costs down, etc.) I think Coursera has some courses on Supply Chain and procurement that could be beneficial. Otherwise, a lot of it is infact like self-learning. There's lots of textbooks on category management, etc. and you just kinda piecemeal it together.",

  "title": "Inventory Management Dilemma: Should ROP for a Warehouse supplying retail stores Include Store Inventory?",
  "content": "I have a question about managing inventory for a central warehouse servicing multiple retail stores based on their total sales. Specifically, how should I determine the reorder point (ROP) for the warehouse? Should the ROP consider only the warehouse's inventory levels, or should it also include the combined inventory of all the retail stores? Would this differ if the warehouse functions as a cross-docking facility versus a break-bulk facility? I appreciate any insights on this! Thank you! Edit: Thanks for the responses. I might not have been clear in my initial post, so let me provide an example: In our system, a planner sets minimum and maximum inventory levels for both the warehouse and individual stores, which are tracked in our ERP system. Store levels are based on their demand, while the warehouse levels reflect total store demand. Orders are placed when the warehouse reaches a ROP calculated as follows: 1. Daily Demand: Total expected usage from forecasts. 2. Anticipated Lead Time: Supplier to warehouse plus warehouse to stores. 3. Safety Stock: (Z × σLT × DD avg) or another formula as needed. When the net available quantity (on-hand inventory – committed inventory + current replenishment) hits the ROP, an order should be placed. My question is: Should the warehouse order based on its own net available quantity or the combined net available quantity of both the warehouse and stores? For instance: Warehouse ROP: 20; Warehouse net available quantity: 20; Warehouse + stores net available quantity: 120. Should an order be placed because the warehouse's net available quantity reached the ROP, or should no order be placed since the combined quantity is well above the ROP?",

  "content": "As a buyer for a produce distribution company, I was informed by our GM that buyers should conduct \"quality control\" checks on every incoming trailer. This involves inspecting 1-2 cases from each truck to identify and document any deficiencies, such as rotten or bruised items and low box counts. However, with my current responsibilities—meetings, emails, logistical issues, and inventory monitoring—I find it challenging to dedicate 20-30 minutes per truck (5-7 daily). While we do occasionally check trucks upon arrival, I also perform daily warehouse inspections for product longevity. I proposed hiring a QA/inventory specialist or having the warehouse staff manage this during receiving, as we currently lack an inventory management role. Is it typical in the fresh produce distribution industry for buyers to handle QA on every inbound trailer? Would it be sensible to hire someone focused on inventory/QA instead of relying on buyers?",

There can be more, but these are the basic ones.\n\nAnd as a QA, your main goals are: mitigate defect parts being detected in the operation and at the customer and report on quality standards of each vendor.\n\nAs you may notice, the role of a QA creates friction in the “happy flow” of a buyer. Therefore, for you to meet the buyer’s goals it might be convenient to overlook quality standards.\n\nPractical example: if the operation is close to stop due to a certain material shortage, and the truck that just arrived at the facility doesn’t pass quality standards, you might feel the need to overlook them in order to not stop the operation and not to affect your buyer’s goals that might affect your bonus.",

  "content": "I’ve seen some discussions on this topic, but most responses are from nearly a year ago or from less experienced individuals (I have nearly ten years). The remote job market has worsened recently, especially with layoffs (I was affected). For those who secured remote roles, what strategies helped you stand out? I’ve been refining my cover letters, but they haven’t led to interviews, despite spending hours on them. How long did it take you to land a remote position? I have substantial experience, nearly ten years in inventory management and capacity planning, including S&OP, forecasting, production planning, and informal demand planning. I’ve served as an operations manager and led teams in two roles. I excel in Excel and consistently receive positive feedback on my work. I’ve developed my own forecasting tools, worked on inventory program implementations, and have 3-4 years of SAP experience, although my production planning was primarily with industry-specific MES/APS systems or an older MRP system (QAD). I adapt quickly to new systems; for instance, I had to learn a new inventory management system on short notice to train users. My previous boss even assigned me a computer science intern due to my technical skills, including my SAP experience and complex forecasting spreadsheets. We were working on process automation before the company could no longer afford him. This reads like a resume without the numbers, right? I have strong experience but struggle with visibility. The only gap in my background is specific sourcing/vendor management. I’ve communicated with suppliers, worked on RFQs, and negotiated prices, but I haven’t held a formal vendor management role. I worry this might hinder me, yet I can’t be the only one landing jobs without every specific requirement. I previously posted in another group, and someone suggested IBP roles given my broad experience, which interests me, but I still need to stand out among many qualified candidates. I’m open to in-office work; I did so in my last job and was hybrid before that. However, I relocated to an area with a limited job market and am looking locally. Opportunities that match my skills and previous salary are primarily in healthcare, a field where I lack experience. Most positions pay significantly less than what I earned, despite having an Ivy League degree and an MBA. Living costs are high, so I can’t return to my previous salary from when I had just a few years of experience.",

Integration of sales across various platforms (Magento, Shopify, custom sites, Etsy, Amazon). 4. Capability to manage multi-dimensional product attributes and hierarchies (distinct items, color, size, dimensions, and business categories for analytics). 5. Integration with QuickBooks for financials (sales, returns, purchasing of raw materials and finished goods, production, and inventory). 6. Synchronization of inventory across platforms based on BOM availability, ensuring that if five products share a component, the website reflects the minimum available quantity of that component, updating as sales occur across all commerce sites—this is the most critical requirement.",

For instance, Primark and Zudio from Trent Ltd exemplify this outside the US; Primark achieves around 10 inventory turns annually without e-commerce, while Zudio in India accomplishes 14 turns, keeping offerings fresh and reducing markdowns. Their effective inventory management allows them to thrive in competitive markets. What are other notable inventory turnover success stories?",

I ran a paper plant for a year with less than 10 calendar days on hand.  At 15 we had to use outside storage warehouses.  The hardest part is convincing managment that 2 days down a month is better than 24 all at once at the end of the year when they finally realize the product isn't selling to capacity. God help you if they use GM accounting.\n\nWalmart sells their product before they pay for it, essentially running a float on suppliers' money.\n\nThe reality is that warehousing costs for most businesses are way less than COGS, so there is only so much juice to get from the squeeze.  If this were not true, we wouldn't import so much from Asia to the US, that supply chain is terrible, but we do it and run larger inventory as a result because cost of goods is typically an order of magnitude larger than warehousing period costs.

  "content": "Hello everyone, I began my career in SCM Back Office with a Swiss chemical company in India. I then moved into Master Data, Analytics (mainly creating Excel reports), Supply Chain Analytics (reporting within the supply chain), and worked as a Demand and Inventory Manager (overseeing supply/demand planning and inventory). For the last few years, I've been a Global Pricing Analyst, totaling around 12 years of experience. I'm skilled in Excel (including macros), Power BI, am nearly finished learning Python, and have basic SQL knowledge. I aim to return to the supply chain field and explore advanced topics where I can utilize my analytics skills. I'm considering these options and would appreciate your insights: 1. CPIM: This would deepen my understanding of inventory management, scheduling, and planning, allowing me to enhance my role through analytics, given my background. 2. CSCP: This certification is reportedly more recognized than CPIM, but it includes topics like sourcing and logistics that I'm less interested in. Does it sufficiently cover planning and inventory management? My next role will likely focus on these areas. 3. MITx Supply Chain Management (edX): This program seems comprehensive and affordable, but I've heard it may not be highly regarded by recruiters. 4. Coursera/Other Courses: I have a year of Coursera Plus access, allowing me to take courses like Supply Chain Analytics (Rutgers) and others at no extra cost. I also have Udemy courses on SCM KPIs, inventory management, and planning that I could complete to demonstrate my knowledge in interviews. I would greatly appreciate your feedback on the best path for me. Thank you!",

More useful for managers and anybody working on demand side (pricing, forecast, etc).\n\n\nCPIM: focus on tactical knowledge (e.g., how does S&OP $ plan flow down to MRP grid?). More useful for planners.\n\n\nCSCP has a large overlap with CPIM in materials (you won't lose out on substance by taking either, especially if the knowledge area you want is somewhere between S&OP and MRP). However, what they ask & emphasize in the quizzes and questions are often different.\n\n\nIf you want to take only 1, go CSCP. You will eventually be a manager, you may not stay a planner forever.\n\n\nIf money isn't concern, I'd say take one and then refresh your memory a few yrs later with the other one (e.g., take CPIM, then start CSCP 3 yrs later).\n\n\nMicroMaster complements both because it extends what you know with advanced math stuffs like Holt Winters.\n\n\nPurely for resume? APICS is better. Not because of the substance (all are equally good), but because APICS keyword carries more weight.",

      "body": "Looks like you’re in a great position with your current SC skills! What’s your educational background?\n\nI usually recommend starting with CSCP if you're looking for a quicker certification, especially if you're transitioning from another field or don't have a degree. But, based on your experience and considering your next role will likely focus on planning and inventory management, CPIM might be the better option for you.\n\nCPIM takes around 4-6 months to complete (with 3 textbooks), and it covers planning and inventory in much greater depth. CSCP, which takes 3-4 months (with 2 textbooks), does touch on those topics, but not in as much detail as CPIM. If you start with CPIM, CSCP will feel easier afterward.\n\nAs for Coursera courses, in your case, I'd recommend skipping them. They provide basic information but might be too easy given your experience. Instead, I'd focus on certifications like CPIM, CSCP, or even the MITx Supply Chain courses, which are much more recognized in the industry. MITx’s SC0x (Analytics) and SC1x (Fundamentals) would offer more value, especially with your analytics background.\n\nThat said, I recommend starting with an ASCM certification like CPIM or CSCP before diving into MITx. Once you have that foundational knowledge, you can then take the **MITx SC1x Supply Chain Fundamentals** course. Despite the name, it’s not really an introductory class—it's quite challenging! But it would complement your ASCM studies and provide a deeper dive into supply chain topics\n\nThe **MITx MicroMasters in Principles of Manufacturing** could also be worth exploring—it aligns closely with CPIM’s focus on inventory and planning, but with a slightly different approach. Boths MM programs typically take just over a year to complete, and you can re-evaluate your path after completing a few courses, deciding whether to pursue another ASCM certification, continue with MITx, or even consider a master’s degree.\n\nBoth CSCP and CPIM both have a free demo of the first module of the course. Additionally, the MITx MM classes can be audited for free or pay $100 to $200 USD with a discount code to get the cert/credits.\n\nLastly, other certs like the IBF CPF (Forecasting), Lean Six Sigma Green Belt, or PMP could be valuable down the line. If you go with CPIM, you're already covering many of the key concepts in Lean Six Sigma, so grabbing a Green Belt afterward would be a smart move.\n\nGood luck!",

  "content": "I recently read an article about \"quiet promotion\" and found it relatable. As a recent international graduate, I began working as a receiver at the company’s new distribution center right after graduation, and I've been here for four months. I've shown interest in growth, and opportunities arose because the Logistics Coordinator left and my team lead is occupied with other tasks. My daily responsibilities include: receiving POs, transfers, and returns; managing yard receipts; coordinating with the order fulfillment team and inventory; booking inbound containers and shipments; scheduling temp workers; communicating discrepancies to suppliers and buyers; coordinating with purchasing on PO or packing slip issues; and tracking inventory for two other warehouses while creating transfer orders based on quantities. My salary is $22/hr pre-tax, totaling about $33k annually after tax. I also need to discuss sponsorship for my stay in the country after three years. What should I do? Additionally, I plan to pursue Lean Six Sigma Green Belt, CPIM, and CSCP for further industry growth. When should I discuss this with management?",

My experience includes: \n\n- Logistics Specialist at a 3PL for 1 year, earning $35k, focusing on order expediting and quotes.\n- Transportation Consultant at a freight company for 2 years, with a $65k base plus 2% commission, but left due to the stress of managing sales and accounts without support.\n- Logistics/Materials Coordinator in oil and gas for 1 year, earning $112k.\n\nI can't see comments due to low Karma, so I may repost later as the insights I've seen are valuable.

It’s a really hard time just in general to find work, so you’re especially going to have a hard time.\n\nYou will most likely need to take a pay cut and ‘start over’ so to speak to get some wider experience if you want to get out of the logistics box. You’re going to have to go entry level on a new area if you want to get into supply chain management. I’d maybe build off that materials coordinator bit and maybe try to get into purchasing or procurement or something along those lines.\n\nAnd the whole ‘project management’ thing is tough…a lot of PM work is contract or temporary work. You’d want to get a PMP certification to do that. You need to have a ton of experience, since you’re generally being asked to do a lot of optimization work, compliance work, implementing changes etc all of which require an intimate base knowledge of whatever field you work in. Based upon your current experience I wouldn’t guess you have enough knowledge in any one area to be a project manager in logistics.",

      "body": "Posted this the other day for someone:\n\nBut, first, you might want to look at getting a lean six sigma green belt since you are working as a machine adjuster now. CPIM will align more with what you are doing now, but CSCP will be a bit easier. Either way laying down a good LSS foundation will help you in your current job and on the CSCP and the CPIM exams.\n\nASCM offers two major certifications: **CSCP** and **CPIM**. If you're deciding where to start, I’d recommend beginning with **CSCP**, as it tends to be a bit easier due to its shorter length in terms of textbooks.\n\n* **CSCP**: Focuses on the broader supply chain, including suppliers, production, and distribution. It’s great for those looking to understand end-to-end supply chain operations.\n   * **Study Material**: Only 2 books to cover.\n   * **Time to Complete**: Typically takes about 3 to 6 months to finish.\n* **CPIM**: Dives deeper into planning and inventory management within the manufacturing process. Ideal for those focused on production and operations management.\n   * **Study Material**: 3 books to cover.\n   * **Time to Complete**: Generally takes about 4 to 8 months to finish.\n\nChoosing between them depends on your career goals—CSCP for a broader supply chain perspective and CPIM for specialized knowledge in production and inventory management.\n\n**Lean Six Sigma** concepts are also integrated throughout ASCM's materials. To build a strong foundation, consider starting with a **free White Belt** certification from the **CSSC**. From there, you can progress to Yellow Belt and Green Belt. All the books are free to download on their site \\[[Link](https://www.sixsigmacouncil.org/six-sigma-white-belt-certification/)\\]. The WB book will only take you 1 to 2 days to read.\n\nASCM has a free demo of CSCP module 1, so check it out for free and see what you think about it \\[[Link](https://www.ascm.org/lp/cscp-free-demo/)\\]. Remember to use a promo code and become a member to save money.\n\nHot tips: Use Pocket Prep questions everyday, get a reading app to listen to the material, read the The Machine That Changed the World, The Toyota Way and The Goal.",

In my past job, I handled shipping, inventory management, and vendor issues, often missing breaks, and I was misled about a promised raise.

However, I have an interview for an inventory specialist position at an aerospace company that pays $3-7 more per hour and is only a 10-minute commute.

I work in procurement and have studied CompSci so feel like I can answer this question.   \n  \nAs a result of being a function of an organsation - supply chain is limited to ventures that involve 'problem solving' for other organisations. This basically pigeon holes you into consultancy or developing SaaS platforms to deliver solutions if you are staying under the umbrella of Supply Chain.\n\nAs you get experience, you can gain the skillset required to partner with someone and start a venture in any type of physical goods.\n\nRe consulting - From my experience logistics is the furthest ahead in regard to technology adoption and outsourcing, but I believe predictive analytics is going to become industry standard for all businesses that have an S&OP process as well as further afield in SC so its anyones game going fwd.",

The process you describe is consistent with that, but obviously very manual. \n\nFor comparison, I'll share a basic indirect buyer process in our business, but it does not reflect all potential process variations or distinctions between 'large' and 'small' or capex vs non capex purchase procurement. For context, we run ~500,000 PO's across ~$2B of indirect and capital spending. My cloud team built and implemented the new processes using a mix of new and existing technologies, my procurement team handles most but not all procurement, and my ops (buyer) team is responsible for execution under a shared services model, however not all businesses are using all of the functionalities yet \n\n\n1. A member of the company needs an item\n1. They create a **requisition** in our Cloud procurement system. If the product/service needed is from one of 40+ ecommerce enabled suppliers, the requester uses an integrated shopping tool to search across suppliers for the best price, given lead time and other factors. \n1. If the request is for a higher value material or service, they submit a requisition with attachments showing any prior quotes obtained or suppliers identified. The request is handed off to the sourcing team to manage a negotiation, or preferably, a reverse auction with qualified suppliers.  \n1. The awarded supplier and firm cost is identified in the requisition. Payment terms are defined based upon system setup and/or sourcing event terms and conditions. \n1. The requisition is sent electronically to be approved by the budget owner and potentially higher levels based upon the value of the purchase. The approver can approve via email. \n1. The requisition is automatically converted into a purchase order, and sent via XML integration if an ecommerce supplier or direct from system .pdf/email. \n1. The buyer receives either an email or electronic order confirmation from the supplier \n1. The requester receives both an approval notification and supplier acknowledgement with expected ETA\n1. The PO is 'received' by the requisitioner upon delivery or completion of services\n1. Invoices are automatically converted to text via OCR and matched to the PO and receipt (3 way match on all PO's). Unmatched invoices that require POs under our PO policy are escalated to procurement for triage. Invoices against un-recieved invoices/PO's trigger automated notifications to the requester to please update receipt status.  \n\n\nRoadmap technology and business process plans include:\n\n* Bid-via-email, with means to provide market feedback via email, to reduce supplier setup and training time in Ariba. \n \n* Reverse auction and bid via email prices will automatically be converted to agreements with lines that can be matched/fed into the purchase order price lines\n\n* Toolcrib software replenishment signals will be integrated to Cloud to auto-create purchase orders which are then matched to supplier invoices. Deliveries can be received and put-away using pre-printed bar-coded receipts. Bin doors in vending machines are programmed to automatically open based upon put-away receipts (\"put-away to light\" similar to 'pick to light' systems)\n \n* We will receive electronic ASN (Automated ship notification), updating expected delivery dates. Receiving of goods will be automated based upon ASN; final delivery confirmation. \n  \n* Invoices for key ecommerce enabled suppliers will be electronically sent via XML and auto-reconciled to the purchase price. \n\n* We will benchmark and re-negotiate complex Statements of Work projects using AI driven software (already being tested) on a time and hours basis.\n\n* Integrated Supplier portal will be available for well qualified suppliers enabling them to view payment status, update contact details, submit compliance disclosures, manually update ship and intransit status and submit requests to change billing information.",

  "content": "I received a new contract for a promotion with a 10% salary increase, which is about 4-5 times the current inflation rate. Initially, I felt slightly disappointed as it was 2-3% below my expectations, but after some research, I realized it aligns with market rates for someone with my 6-7 years of supply chain experience, including 4 years as a supervisor. The job title \"Procurement and S&OP Manager\" (managing two others and about 10 indirect employees) seems more valuable than the salary itself. I’m 31, working for a Forbes 500 company in the EU, and will have significant responsibilities, such as collaborating with senior managers and overseeing the inventory for my business unit, which includes managing a $30 million stock and a $6-7 million logistics budget across two EMEA distribution centers, with annual sales of $250 million and new product introductions. My past experience includes leading a remote team of buyers, owning supply chain processes, implementing SAP, and relocating production and distribution. In the future, I plan to implement a new business planning tool. I aim to advance my career, and many companies are seeking candidates with S&OP management experience. While I’m not trying to boast, I do seek validation that I’m on the right path and that this role will provide further opportunities.",

  "content": "Hello everyone, I'm launching a new nutrition product and often face challenges with inventory management and tracking ingredients and suppliers. Currently, everything is done manually, requiring extensive communication with my co-packer and managing numerous spreadsheets. I'm considering developing an inventory management software tailored for food businesses like mine. My ideas include: \n\n- **Inventory Tracking**: The software would monitor the quantity and location of all ingredients, providing real-time visibility into inventory levels.\n- **Automated Reordering**: It would automatically create purchase orders when stock falls below a set level, reducing manual ordering and preventing stockouts.\n- **Recipe Management**: Allows input of ingredient amounts according to product formulations, using this data to automate orders based on production plans.\n- **Co-packer Integration**: Connects with co-packer systems to streamline information sharing and automate some communications.\n\nI'm curious about your experiences: What challenges do you face with current inventory management systems? How do you manage ingredient reordering and tracking? Would automated reordering and real-time tracking benefit you? How crucial is co-packer integration and recipe management for your operations? Any feedback would be appreciated!",

  "content": "Hello everyone, I’m relatively new to supply chain, having switched industries two years ago. I’m looking to enhance my resume to transition into a more complex and interesting supply chain role. Currently, I manage the supply chain from a technological perspective, developing and maintaining replenishment models and forecasts, and automating reporting tasks like inventory management, WoS calculations, sales, budget, and fulfillment. I collaborate across the supply chain to improve efficiency and drive transformation. I’m particularly excited about using AI to enhance my models and streamline reporting. I also create dashboards for my team to monitor the supply chain's health using SQL, Power BI, SAS, and Python. I'm interested in roles focused on supply chain management and technology, typically requiring CPIM/CSCP certifications, but I believe CTSC aligns best with my goals. I want my next role to closely integrate IT, utilize AI, and be at a mid-senior level. What recommendations do you have?",

But don't expect to learn any advanced supply planning or optimization techniques.\n\nNone of my 3 certs has a math/quantitative/tech focus. I did a 1 years master of analytics program to fill this gap.\n\nI had similar roles and goals to you.  Getting my masters was best decision of my life. Unlocked my career potential.",

      "body": "If you are looking to pad the resume then get a quick win and do CSCP. CTSC is ASCM's newest cert and while I'm sure it's useful, most employers probably don't know what it even is. I might consider this after getting a CSCP or CPIM for additional knowledge.\n\nCPIM would probably be the better of the two main ASCM certs. But, CPIM is a grind and it will take about 6 to 12 months of studying to complete it. CSCP will be a bit easier and quicker to do. It should take 4-6 months to complete. Ask ChatGPT to compare the two certs. Really have it break it down for you so you can make an informed decision.   \n  \nFrom what you described in your job duties and what you are capable of doing it could be time to start thinking about a masters. Look into the MITx MicroMasters program there is a class that is close to what CTSC is trying offer, and you won't have to learn it from a stuffy-boring text book. It's called: Supply Chain Technology and Systems: [Link](https://www.edx.org/learn/supply-chain-management/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-supply-chain-technology-and-systems)",

We’ve designed some for our customers and they work beautifully. In bulk, it’s very inexpensive as well. The other option is to simply use paper bubble wrap. Google it and you should find a vendor in your country. The main thing with glass packaging is to make sure it is wrapped with a material that is spongy enough (not very stiff paper) to absorb impact but stiff enough to hold the jar in place inside the box. So if you’re using paper bubble wrap, make sure its outer packaging is not loose - like a courier poly bag. It should be a box and the wrapping should be enough that it fits firmly inside the box without moving about.",

In addition to that it's a very complex area and even those materials deemed \"biodegradable\" probably won't at home, only in special industrial composting facilities that generally don't exist and any packaging haa very little chance of actually reaching one.  \n\n\nAs the other comment says for sustainability you need to look at materials, likely strong plastic pouches that are fully recyclable. But, anything too flimsy or \"film\" or thin in my experience won't be recycled. You can see though from the comments that experience differs widely.   If it means anything in the UK a couple of the major English tea brands surprisingly just have teabags in a carton, though a well developed one that would let less air in, though most have a foil or cellophane bag in the box filled with about 20-50 tea bags.  If this was me selling these teabags I would consider trying to implement either a recyclable strong stand up pouch or a very thin cellophane bag which goes in a well designed carton with a cutout to act as a window ",

  "content": "Recently, the global push for sustainability has notably influenced various industries, particularly the packaging sector. In Europe, the Returnable Packaging Market has gained momentum as both businesses and consumers favor eco-friendly options. This article discusses the trends, drivers, and challenges in the European Returnable Packaging Market, highlighting innovative advancements toward sustainability. \n\nReturnable packaging, or reusable packaging, utilizes containers, crates, or pallets that can be returned and reused multiple times, contrasting sharply with single-use packaging that exacerbates pollution and resource depletion. This approach helps reduce waste and lowers carbon emissions linked to production and disposal.\n\nThe European Returnable Packaging Market has been steadily growing due to regulatory measures, consumer awareness, and corporate commitment to sustainability. Industry reports predict strong growth in the market as returnable packaging becomes more widely adopted across sectors.\n\nKey growth drivers include:\n\n- **Environmental Awareness:** Increased concern over issues like plastic pollution and climate change has prompted a shift toward returnable packaging as a solution.\n- **Regulatory Initiatives:** European governments have enacted strict regulations to limit single-use plastics, fostering a favorable environment for returnable packaging.\n- **Cost Savings for Businesses:** Although the initial cost of returnable packaging may be higher, long-term savings from reduced waste and shipping costs are encouraging businesses to adopt this approach.\n- **Supply Chain Efficiency:** Returnable packaging improves supply chain efficiency by cutting waste and reducing the need for frequent replenishment of packaging materials, appealing especially to complex supply chains.\n\nHowever, challenges persist in the market:\n\n- **Initial Investment Barriers:** The upfront costs for durable, reusable materials can deter smaller companies with limited capital.\n- **Logistical Complexities:** Implementing a returnable packaging system requires careful logistics for the collection, cleaning, and redistribution of materials, which can be a hurdle for transitioning businesses.\n- **Consumer Education:** Despite growing environmental awareness, some consumers may not fully understand the benefits of returnable packaging, necessitating educational efforts for broader acceptance.\n\nInnovations and trends include:\n\n- **Smart Packaging Solutions:** Technologies like RFID tags and sensors are enhancing tracking and monitoring of packaging assets, improving system efficiency.\n- **Collaborative Efforts:** Companies are increasingly sharing resources, such as pallet pools and container exchanges, to maximize the advantages of returnable packaging.\n- **Material Innovation:** Advances in materials, including biodegradable plastics and innovative composites, are being explored to minimize environmental impact.\n- **Circular Economy Integration:** Emphasizing reusable and recyclable products aligns well with returnable packaging principles, and many companies are",

Consequently, people are seeking alternative packaging options to cardboard boxes that are budget-friendly. Here are some options to consider:\n\n- **Seaweed Packaging**: Companies are focusing on seaweed packaging, using gelatin extracted from seaweed, which functions similarly to cornstarch.\n\n- **Cornstarch Packaging**: This eco-friendly option, derived from corn, resembles plastic packaging. It can be tailored to the product's dimensions and is used for solid bottles and loose bags, though its production competes with food industry corn demand.\n\n- **Mushroom Packaging**: Made from the inedible parts of mushrooms, this affordable option is more sustainable than seaweed and cornstarch packaging.\n\n- **Edible Packaging Material**: Available in various shapes, this packaging is designed to be consumed, eliminating the need for disposal.\n\n- **Biodegradable Air Peanuts**: These environmentally friendly fillers protect sensitive products from damage and serve as a sustainable alternative to Styrofoam.",

  "title": "Why Choosing a Warehouse Management System over Computer Vision Could Be Your Best Decision Yet?",
  "content": "Imagine entering a well-organized warehouse where operations run seamlessly—packages are sorted, orders are fulfilled promptly, and every team member is well-equipped with the necessary tools. Now, envision attempting to maintain that level of efficiency by merely observing security camera footage all day. Which scenario appears more effective? Businesses have various options for enhancing operations, with Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) and Computer Vision being two prominent choices. Here’s why investing in a WMS may be the wiser decision for your company.\n\n### Managing Costs\nCost is a critical factor when adopting new technologies. WMS generally requires an investment between $100,000 and $500,000, with straightforward maintenance and quick implementation—often within a few months. In contrast, Computer Vision demands substantial initial spending on cameras and specialized software, with ongoing maintenance that can become costly. Implementation can take up to two years due to extensive data collection and testing. WMS typically provides a return on investment within 12-18 months, while Computer Vision may take years to break even.\n\n### Enhancing Efficiency\nWMS can significantly boost warehouse operations by automating tasks and improving inventory management and order processing. While Computer Vision is useful for specific functions like quality control, it lacks the comprehensive benefits of a WMS and is often viewed as an auxiliary tool rather than a standalone solution.\n\n### Scaling with Your Business\nAs your business expands, your systems must adapt. WMS is designed to accommodate increased volume and complexity, allowing for smooth scaling. In contrast, scaling Computer Vision often involves additional hardware purchases and complex adjustments, driving up costs and implementation time. This inflexibility can hinder growth.\n\n### Utilizing Your Data\nData-driven decision-making is crucial in modern warehouses. WMS offers advanced analytics and integrates seamlessly with other systems, whereas Computer Vision mainly produces visual data that needs further processing for actionable insights. \n\n### The Superior Investment\nWhen evaluating WMS against Computer Vision, WMS emerges as the preferred option for most businesses due to its cost-effectiveness, rapid implementation, scalability, and overall operational impact. While Computer Vision has its niche applications, it lacks the comprehensive management capabilities of a WMS.

  "title": "Inventory and Assets Management Business Processes Automation with Cleverence",
  "content": "### What is Automation in Inventory and Asset Management? \nEfficient inventory and asset management is crucial for businesses. Cleverence enhances these processes through technology like barcodes, auto-ID mobile devices, ERP integration, and business process automation, addressing accuracy and efficiency needs. Barcodes and auto-ID technologies reduce manual data entry errors, ensuring precise inventory levels and asset tracking. Auto-ID mobile devices streamline operations by minimizing reliance on central databases or paperwork. ERP integration is essential for seamless data management. Data capture automation digitizes information using barcode scanners or RFID readers, while business process automation (BPA) encompasses broader operational workflows, integrating various systems for improved efficiency and real-time decision-making.\n\n### Why Customers Choose Cleverence\nCleverence provides a superior solution for automating inventory and asset management, outperforming manual methods, existing ERP modules, and custom development. This chapter highlights its efficiency, integration capabilities, and cost-effectiveness.\n\n### Cleverence vs. Manual Processes\n\"Manual\" processes involve human execution without automated systems, including tasks like:\n- **Manual Data Entry:** Hand-entering data into spreadsheets or databases, sometimes using barcode scanners.\n- **Manual Physical Counts:** Counting inventory by visual inspection and tallying items.\n- **Paper-Based Tracking:** Using printed documents for inventory management.\n- **Manual Reconciliation:** Comparing physical counts with recorded data.\n- **Visual Inspections:** Checking assets without digital tools.\n\nThe misconception that barcode scanners equate to automation overlooks that true automation encompasses the entire data workflow, minimizing manual intervention. Cleverence utilizes mobile devices and an app that provides real-time ERP data, allowing employees to access stock levels and task lists directly on their devices.\n\n### Cleverence vs. ERP Modules\nERP systems manage various business processes but often lack depth in auto-ID and logistics without custom development. Cleverence effectively addresses these gaps. Many ERP systems offer basic auto-ID support, limited customization, and inadequate logistics features. Customizing ERPs can be costly and time-consuming. Cleverence offers advanced auto-ID capabilities, customizable Android apps, and efficient ERP integration, enhancing system functionalities without extensive custom work.\n\n### Cleverence vs. Custom Development\nCustom development can provide tailored solutions but is resource-intensive, costly, and may lack scalability. Cleverence offers ready-to-deploy solutions that are easily integrated and scalable, avoiding the challenges of custom development. Unlike custom projects, which often exceed budgets and timelines, Cleverence uses a device license model, ensuring predictable costs and rapid implementation.\n\n### How to Sell Cleverence",

  "content": "Warehouse efficiency relies heavily on effective receiving processes, with the choice between one-stage and two-stage receiving impacting operational efficiency and automation strategies, thereby influencing supply chain responsiveness and accuracy. The decision depends on inventory characteristics and warehouse needs. One-stage receiving is best for straightforward, uniform product flows, while two-stage receiving is suited for diverse, complex inventories. Automation systems play a key role in linking physical operations with digital processes, automating tasks like scanning goods and managing quality control, which helps prevent errors and streamline operations. \n\nIn one-stage receiving, goods are sent directly to their storage location upon arrival, which is efficient for uniform products or small volumes. Warehouse staff use digital systems to quickly verify SKUs and determine storage spots, enhancing speed and space utilization. For small shipments, a location-first scanning approach is recommended, while larger ones may favor a product-first method, both aiming for efficient handling without intermediate steps.\n\nConversely, two-stage receiving involves unloading goods to a staging area for quality checks and sorting before placing them in storage. This method suits shipments with varied SKUs and supports meticulous inventory management. Cleverence can adapt to multiple receiving stages, ensuring effective handling of both small and large shipments by prioritizing either product or location based on the inventory specifics.\n\nThe decision between one-stage and two-stage receiving affects inventory accuracy and labor costs. One-stage receiving minimizes handling and potential errors, relying heavily on initial checks and automation tools for accuracy. In contrast, two-stage receiving offers more verification points to catch discrepancies early, though it can be more labor-intensive. \n\nOne-stage receiving generally incurs lower labor costs due to fewer handling steps, making it efficient for operations with limited staff. However, it demands high accuracy from the start. Two-stage receiving, while possibly more costly in labor, allows for specialization, reducing errors and improving throughput. Ultimately, the choice should consider the balance between labor savings and the risk of inaccuracies, with advanced automation systems enhancing both methods by improving data accuracy and labor efficiency.",

Barcode scanners are vital for quickly capturing product information, ensuring accurate inventory management, and streamlining tasks like receiving and shipping. The scanner's environment influences your choice; rugged models are needed for industrial settings, while lighter ones suit retail. Consider battery life to ensure it lasts an entire shift, and check connectivity options for seamless integration with your network. Performance in speed and accuracy is crucial, as is the device's ergonomics for user comfort during extended use.\n\nOdoo's limited hardware support complicates this selection, often recommending pre-configured Zebra devices. However, not all scanners integrate well, so it's important to choose compatible devices. An effective alternative for Chrome users is third-party software like Cleverence Warehouse 15, which enhances compatibility and functionality. Cleverence supports a wider range of Android barcode scanners, ensuring smooth integration with Odoo Inventory and improving real-time data management.\n\nCleverence also offers advanced features for tracking serial and batch numbers, optimizing storage, and streamlining operations. This software not only expands hardware options but also boosts operational efficiency and flexibility, making it an attractive choice for businesses aiming to improve their inventory management beyond Odoo's standard capabilities.",

We started about 2.5 years ago with a 10k sqft facility. \n\nOptions I would recommend to get short term leads include:\n1. Get listed as a warehouse on existing directories (like Olimp, crossdockbuddy, transloadnow, and loadmatch)\n2. Find local ports or other similar groups where carriers, forwarders, and brokers that serve your area may be listed. For example for our Tampa warehouse, we went on the Port of Tampa and Port of Manatee directories that publish logistics companies that serve the ports with their phone numbers and emails. We reached out to these folks and now get leads from drayage carriers we meant via this\n3. Run paid Google ads (requires a website). We get most our leads from this and from organic website content that is published so we show up when people search online for transloading, reworking, and other warehousing type work in the Tampa area.\n4. Reach out to local distribution centers and beverage distributors to offer restack and cross dock services. We restack loads for a couple load distribution centers (normally dry and liquid food goods). We also do a lot of beverage restacking, and there seems to be many beverage distributors in each region and liquid loads are likely to shift.\n 5. Try to get on the internal warehouse lists of larger freight brokers like TQL, Nolan Transport Group, Echo, and similar large companies. The only way we have had luck with this is by a sales rep Googling for a restack warehouse then we do the job and later followup to see if they have any other projects we can help with. \n\nI hope these ideas are helpful.

  "content": "I believe I can improve my DC performance, but I'm currently at a standstill. I work for a 3PL company that only handles the receipt and delivery of parcels, so our inventory turnover should be high due to our location. The DC receives numerous parcels daily that need sorting by destination. However, our outbound performance, based on timely dispatch (parcels received under 30 minutes before dispatch), is low at 80-90%. This is due to issues like missing parcels and slow loading/unloading. \n\nWe use woven bags for parcel storage because they are waterproof and prevent theft, but they create handling challenges since they aren't flat like boxes. We previously tried using boxes but reverted to bags. I'm new here and would like to understand the benefits of using boxes over bags. Using bags leads to damage as operators manually toss them from the truck, creating disorganized piles that can increase loading times. \n\nI’m considering using mobile carts instead of placing parcels on the ground. I found a container design that could accommodate various parcel shapes, but I’m unsure if it’s practical for unloading. While it facilitates quick movement in the warehouse, it doesn’t solve loading and unloading issues, and we can’t stack them high, limiting capacity. Additionally, the size of the parcel piles varies significantly based on their destination. \n\nWe have a gravity conveyor, but operators prefer throwing parcels for speed, unless they’re already grouped in baskets for scanning. However, managing baskets across the warehouse network is complicated. I'm overwhelmed with the issues we need to address and would appreciate your insights. Thank you.",

I received an X12 advanced ship notification (856) doc saying I'll get qty 25 of widget ABC on this shipment) Then you actually receive 25 of of widget ABC, barcode 123,... And assume you'll get another ASN then they ship the rest. Then they send you an X12 invoice for payment (810) and then when you get the other 25 you send the payment, reference the EDI invoice.\n\nThen there's a ton of other EDI docs that convey things like, order changes, acknowledgements, cancellations, inventory positions, sell-through data etc..\n\nIf you want to go this route, let me know,.. if you PM me, I contacts at organizations that do nothing but setup retailers with traditional EDI, and we do enough volume that a referral will probably get you into the pipe faster.\nYou would probably be fine with an EDI portal that does all the mapping in the background and just gives you the results in a webpage, or a file and then you could do some local scriping (in excel or a local script) to move the portal A to your systems B&C. Or for a little more $$ just have them incorporate your systems formats into the portal.\n\nAt that point you just tell your vendors you use the following  X12 documents (810, 850, 856 etc..) and/or a phone number to the portal programming dept.\nAt that point you push your standard and it's your vendors/suppliers and it's their job to comply\n(at least that's how it works for the big-box retailers)",

  "content": "Hello everyone, what processes do you use for managing receiving errors? We primarily utilize EDI with ASN labels and create our own labels for internal purposes. We encounter two main errors: vendor errors and internal errors. Secondary errors include incorrectly tagged UPCs and mixed cases. We allow a 100% overage before the system rejects a shipment, and typically, we issue a new PO for the overage, making it difficult to catch mistakes until later. This results in many PODs from vendors, as the overage often signifies a shortage due to an error. When an error is identified, it is sent to a specific area for investigation (if we adhere to our SOP), but sometimes it is just reshelved. Currently, there is no reporting process for this, leading to inventory accuracy issues, which we then manually adjust upon discovery, creating further inventory complications. Our main software is JDA, along with a custom WMS. I'm curious about how our process compares to others. How do you receive products? How do you manage overages and shortages? What steps do you take to correct your inventory? How do you handle reshelving in your forward pick, if applicable? Do you cross-dock? How many warehouses do you operate? What software do you use? Do you rely on 3PLs for receiving, and is it done in-house or off-site?",

There's a few was to approach this, but you're likely going to need some level or OMS for order import to a centralized system from your different sales channels (Wordpress's Woo, eBay, Amazon, Point of Sale etc). This will help organize customer info, inventory info and a few other things. The software I've worked with are MOM, Stone Edge, and Netsuite. My favorite bang for the buck was Stone Edge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPart 2 is the WMS or fulfillment side of things. at $2m a year you've got a respectable number of packages going out a day most likely. I've worked with QSSI's Powerhouse (Absolutely solid for the price), High Jump (not so great web-based interface) and Manhattan's Scale which is comprehensive, but can get pricey. The features I'd look for to minimize shrink or lost items are as follows:\n\n1. Receiving against purchase orders\n2. Put away module (from receiving locations to racks/ bins). It's helpful when you can configure business rules to make it predictable where your products are going\n3. Pick/ Pack/ Ship module. A good starting point would be a paper pick ticket system which is pretty standard and easy to train on. the concept is send a picker out with a cart and ticket, and have them bring it to a packer who validates the correct items are picked prior to shipping.\n\nThe OMS and WMS might not be the same software suite, so check to see who's software integrates with others nicely. Some of the listed software about will likely be able to be a good stepping stone as a singular solution until your business scales even further. Good luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Getting setup with their EDI partners (and eventually going direct when you prove yourself) will seriously streamline everything you do, and give you great tracking and accountability. \n\nI would look at an integrated WMS/ERP like Epicor or Netsuite (Both talk EDI and cover all the bases you need now and later) and that way your data is all in one place, not jumping through hoops, connectors and translators.\n\nA lot of people push newer light cloud systems, but really if you're planning on doing this for more than a short term, investing is a scalable ERP/WMS is one of the the best things you can do for your business if you do it early.\n(it's more expensive to buy an enterprise \"base\" package, but well worth it for not having to re-shop again in 2 years if you see any growth or you get heavy retailer requirements.\n\nYou mentioned lead commerce and trade gecko, but those are (what I would consider) to light/limited for what you're doing and (sounds like) you plan on doing. This is tying back into QB and it's both are going to start to show serious scale problems when you're dealing with multiple retailers and their various invoice/PO/ASN/reporting requirements.\n\n(Don't forget, if you don't get it right you get a chargeback, for many retailers chargebacks are their 2nd largest revenue stream)\n\nWe actually had some guys who are Ex Distribution/3PL that do consulting for WMS/ERP purchases work with us (as they've done it all and know which parts you'll need now, later, and maybe later) They checked out our process, killed about 30 potential options right of the bat (with detailed explanations as to why each one fell short) and got us down to a list of 4 and then budget and \"Look and feel\" handled the rest in short order.\n\nIf you want contact info PM me, they're good guys and have high secondary incomes, so they're affordable and work with the top 10 enough to get some good discounts.",

  "content": "Hi Reddit, this is my first post, and I hope it's a suitable place for it. I would appreciate any advice to improve inventory accuracy at my new company. Previously, I managed a larger but more organized inventory in warehouse distribution. Now, I work for a small business focused on custom A/V installations. Here are key factors affecting our inventory management: \n\n- We use QuickBooks: Premier Retail Edition solely for inventory tracking.\n- Our main warehouse stores most installation products, which are received there.\n- We have five stocked installer vehicles that carry inventory for jobs. Installers are supposed to notify the owner via email when they use items from their trucks.\n- Customer jobs are billed periodically as portions are completed, meaning goods leaving the warehouse don't immediately update inventory in QuickBooks.\n\nIn summary, we lack inventory management software, and items can be in six locations at once (excluding job sites with unbilled goods). Is the solution just implementing inventory management software? If so, what would you recommend? The company is growing quickly, with plans for more installers, vehicles, and a second warehouse in the next two years. Thank you for any advice!",

Most will let you set containers or locations and let you scan inventory between them via barcoding. So you have inventory in warehouse. Someone with a installer truck requests some parts and you scan it from the WH to the truck. When they sell it off the truck you show it as shipped/sold/etc.. and check it out of inventory.\n\nThis way you know who has what where (and can tie it back to trending/metrics/shrink calculations etc.. etc..)\n\nThere's a lot of software out there to handle this type of stuff, but I always suggest looking at what you'll need for the long term when building a WMS solution. What volumes will you have and what functionality do you think you'll need in 2-5 years. (and of course the biggie for everyone what's your budget)\n\nWe've worked with everything from freeware to $1M+ systems and everything in between and what I suggest to everyone is to look at your processes for a week or so, talk to all the key players and come up with:\n\nYour list of core requirements. \nA list of wish/want/nice to have, might need in 3 years, bells and whistles. \nFigure out if you have any other systems or processes you will want to hook into.\nand \nDecide on your budget. \n\nThat will give you a much better window of available solutions and then you can sort through the short list to determine what packages are best for you.",

Input - when new items come in they're received. \nWhen you receive you print a item label and depending on how much you want to spend, have directed putaway \"put this item in aisle b row 2\" Or \"cabinet b, shelf 2\" Or if your volume is low enough you could scan the item barcode, then the barcode of the location as you put it away wherever you want.  (obviously this means you need to barcode your locations as well, be it shelves or aisles or buildings.)\n\nB. Storage - At the end of either process you have Item (with all it's details that you entered, size, price, photo etc.. whatever you want) and you have it's location.\n\nC. Output - On sale, you pick/ship the item (even it that's just pulling it from inventory and handing it to someone who just bought it) \n\nAt this point you can show (most WMS's have a portal) what inventory is where and how much of it there is.\n\nIn addition, you now have lifecycle historicals on these objects and can do fun Business Intelligence stuff with that data in the future. (How long do watches normally take to auction off, what item gets damaged in storage the most, what is the average storage time/space that's not billed for etc.. etc..etc..)\n\nDepending on your budget, there are systems that can do all of this, and a ton more. but I'm assuming you're looking for something in the lower end.\nI suggest you build a list of options you want/need and browse this list:\n[List of major WMS systems](http://www.capterra.com/inventory-management-software/)\n\nThis is a pretty extensive list, but I'd suggest Fishbowl, Delivrd, inflow, and Zenventory based on first blush.\n\nAlso, I've worked with people at auction houses before. One suggestion I have is to make sure you get removable labels and/or string tags with barcodes if you're tracking them. (don't cause item damage on add/removal, customers appreciate that)",

We utilize paid ERP software that manages inventory upon item sales, specifically clothing categorized by size. Our inventory includes KITS (collections sold as one) and individual items. We handle inventory for online sales, phone orders, store sales, KITS, transfers, and returns. Currently, our inventory management consists of spot checks, cycle counts, high movement inventory, and tracking high movement vendors and locations. I use scan guns to save barcodes, which I then download and upload to our system to check for abnormal adjustments. I know there are many improvements we can make. Here are some practices we should implement: pack line receiving/shipping, and adding more barcodes, as about 15% of our items lack vendor barcodes. Tagging was considered, but management deemed it time-consuming and a labor waste. Space can also be an issue, as creating room for one item can take more time than anticipated, leading to misplaced inventory. Additionally, we need more labor. I often encounter great ideas while reading, but they don't seem to fit our system. I hope I’ve communicated my situation clearly. Any questions, comments, or suggestions are welcome. Thank you.

Fashion moves and changes, you're typically only seeing a style once a season and that's it. Unfortunately in our environment, you're going to have to deal with tons of re-warehousing for sku consolidation. \n\nIn one of our buildings, we obtain inbound production quantities by ETA. (in your case you could push buyers to advise their planned purchases.) We then take a conservative educated guess on what a given sku's capacity on a GOH bar based on body type, and pre-slot locations. If it's flat pack, we're not preslotting as our bulk picks are from pallet racking, and then we down pick in a downpick area. \n\nAfter we've slotted locations, when we receive that style throughout the season, users are directed where to put away, so it's forced consolidation. Returns are directed to those locations, and in the event something is incorrectly located (not scanned) we can almost always find it right away based on where we initially told the associate to locate to.\n\nOnce a month we run location utilization reports. Then issue re-warehouseing (relocating and consolidation) to consolidate locations. Where one style at height of season could have been 1500 units each size, taking up 5 GOH bars, now can be consolidated to 1/4th a bar.  \n\nI have no idea what system you're on, but directed put away is great for us. We can pre-slot locations based on any factor: vendor, style, color, size, receipt, etc. By using directed putaway, you can have a uniformed warehouse layout by one planner deciding where everything goes. We also scan piece by piece on the inbound, like a supermarket scan, and scan piece by piece on the outbound at packing. Our inventory was 99.98% accurate last year. ",

  "title": "How to Choose Your Inventory Management Software",
  "content": "You may have realized that your operations are suffering from poor organization or data accountability, or you need a better way to manage your inventory. Selecting the right software tailored to your business needs is crucial. Finding the best option can be challenging since software effectiveness is subjective. First, assess your workflow and identify your challenges. Are your daily operations as efficient as you'd like, or do they need a complete overhaul? Consider how much time employees spend tracking inventory, whether in the warehouse or through spreadsheets. Time wasted on these tasks impacts productivity. Evaluate your current inventory management expenses and the losses from inefficiencies. If your existing system costs more than it saves, it's time to reconsider. If you lack a management system and have excess stock or fail to meet demand for popular items, you are incurring losses. Aim for near 100% accuracy in order and fulfillment, which can be hard to achieve without the right tools. Relying on Excel increases the risk of errors, while barcode scanning can enhance accuracy by automating inventory updates. \n\nWhen searching for inventory software, consider industry compatibility, as different sectors have unique needs. E-commerce businesses need integrations with shopping carts, while 3PL companies require client portals. Prioritize cloud-based software for security and ease of access. You may also need hardware like barcode scanners or label printers. Easy data import and export are essential when transitioning to a new system. Look for flexible pricing plans that allow your software to grow with your business. \n\nDon't hesitate to ask for assistance when starting with a new tool; developers appreciate feedback and may provide features you haven't discovered. Integrate all your tools to streamline operations and reduce redundant tasks. \n\nEvaluate the software provider as much as the product itself. Look for flexible contract terms without long commitments or cancellation fees. Seek vendors with genuine industry expertise and proven track records. Post-sale support is vital, so assess the provider’s ability to assist you after purchase. Ensure support comes from knowledgeable staff, and consider testing their responsiveness. Zenventory offers local support and resources to assist users effectively.",

I need to suggest a solution that balances management’s need for control with the technicians' desire for simplicity in complying with new policies.

The EDI capabilities were promising but the company I'm with walked away from the software before I was able to integrate some of our larger customers that had heavy EDI traffic. They ended up being a bit spendy as well. Good for a smaller scale company with a bigger customer base, depending on the specific needs. \n\nYou can also go [here](http://www.softwareadvice.com/scm/third-party-logistics-3pl-software-comparison/) and do a quick visual comparison of what is available as well as request some demos and virtual tours of the ones you think look promising.

I believe this will lower brokers' salaries due to reduced driver competition, allowing drivers to charge more. Additionally, as autonomous trucking advances, brokers may become obsolete, though I don't expect this change for another 20 years. As I'm new to this field, I'd appreciate any insight into whether this career is a good long-term choice, as I define a good career by high earnings. I don't dislike the work; it's just work.",

I've narrowed my options to two paths: advancing in supply chain (which seems limited in salary growth) or transitioning to finance or accounting. I'm unsure what direction to take, but my main motivation is adequate compensation, so I want to shape my career accordingly. Additionally, I have an engineering background and a PG diploma in Business Analytics, so I'm uncertain how pursuing a master's degree would fit in.",

  "content": "I have been job hunting all year and consider myself skilled in interviews. I craft tailored resumes and cover letters for each application. Recently, I interviewed for two similar positions: one as a Business Administrator with a successful custom chemical group and another as a Purchasing Assistant with a renowned food services company specializing in rice. After a successful phone interview for the first role, I declined an in-person interview due to accepting an offer from the second company, which is closer to home.\n\nIn the Purchasing Assistant interview, I was asked about my salary expectations and mentioned $20 an hour, though I should have asked for $25, which is my current freelance rate. The interview went well, and I received a verbal offer. The role involves cross-training across several departments, including HR and logistics, requiring proficiency in SAP FICO, SAP 4HANA, Excel, and inventory management software. I have a background as an Office Manager and Executive Administrative Assistant, but I need to refresh my skills in SAP and Excel before starting next Wednesday.\n\nI am seeking advice from anyone with experience as a Purchasing Assistant, particularly regarding compensation negotiations. I believe $20 an hour is insufficient given the cross-functional nature of the position, and I would like to propose $25 an hour. Additionally, I am a part-time Business Management student with minors in Human Resources and Accounting, holding an Associate Degree in Health Information Technology.\n\nI would appreciate any tips on the responsibilities of this role and advice on finding affordable crash courses for Excel and SAP FICO, as I want to be well-prepared and succeed in this opportunity.",

However, I've been offered an interview for an inventory specialist position at an aerospace company that pays $3-7 more per hour and has a short 10-minute commute. Although I'm attracted to this opportunity, I worry about potentially leaving my enjoyable job for a more stressful one and concerns about job security in the aerospace sector.

About five years ago, I lost satisfaction in my work despite good earnings, and I envied my wife’s corporate job stories. After a year of contemplation, I decided to find a new job, transferring my company shares to my two brothers and other staff, and delegated my responsibilities. After three months of job hunting, I was offered the Director of Operations position at a well-known MNC 4PL company (Company B), which significantly increased my salary. I quickly accepted and started a couple of months later. In this new role, I enjoyed luxuries like a high-performing team and minimal tasks, often working from home without issues. Over time, I felt restless again, so I contacted headhunters to explore new opportunities.\n\nI quickly landed an interview with an MNC electronics manufacturer (Company C) for the Head of Supply Chain position, which came with a 25% pay increase but required regular office hours. I devised a plan to accept the offer without resigning from Company B. For two months, I managed both roles, reporting to Company B daily while also working at Company C. My responsibilities at Company C were manageable, focusing on order processes and vendor management, which I streamlined. I leave Company C at 5 PM, return to Company B to interact with staff, and then go to Company A to handle minor tasks.\n\nNow, I juggle three incomes but am concerned about being discovered. Company B is pushing me for a Regional Senior VP role that would require relocation, which I might resign over if I can’t avoid it. At Company C, my boss is unlikely to retire soon, and in Company A, my brothers are managing well. We’re considering selling the company if the right offer arises. I know this setup won’t last, but it’s been an exciting experience.",

Start by outlining how you plan to use the 3PL, such as for FBA prep or multi-channel fulfillment. After determining your needs, contact potential 3PLs to discuss your requirements and pricing. \n\nHow to choose a 3PL provider? When selecting a fulfillment partner, consider your supply chain factors, such as product sources, packaging, and daily shipping volume. Look for a partner that can reduce costs and has strong shipping carrier relationships, especially if you plan to fulfill through multiple channels. \n\nIs 3PL right for your business? If you want to outsource distribution and fulfillment, 3PLs can help grow your online business by enabling multi-channel sales and secure inventory storage.

However, your target audience will be mid to large enterprises that are mature enough to have their ERP and also work with suppliers who also run on an ERP system. Most brands aur retailers in the western hemisphere and have their suppliers overseas in Asia. The suppliers in Asia may or may not be on a ERP or any sort of software system. Even if they are, they may most likely be running on some local system. These are some of the practical challenges. This has been tried before but never became a large enough business. \n\nHowever, if you identify a good niche/intersection of trade where the multiple trade partners operate on an ERP system that can potentially be integrated, then this idea certainly has legs.",

  "content": "I'm looking for inventory management software that goes beyond partial order fulfillment and includes priority-based order allocation and customer segmentation. While I’ve found tools that can split quantities for partial fulfillment, I need a more comprehensive solution for situations where total orders exceed stock. Ideally, the software would notify me if available stock can't fully meet selected orders upon shipment creation. Then, it should allow me to allocate stock to each order based on prioritization criteria. I want to prioritize based on customer history and interactions, such as giving larger allocations to long-standing or reliable customers, and smaller ones to newer or riskier clients. Essentially, I need a tool that lets me manually distribute available stock based on factors like customer loyalty and payment history. If anyone knows of software that offers this or similar features in inventory management, I’d appreciate your recommendations. Thank you!",

  "content": "Hello everyone! I'm seeking some career advice from the community and would appreciate any insights. Some details are intentionally vague, but feel free to ask for clarification to enhance the quality of responses. I aim to build a solid supply chain career and take on a leadership role. My current goal is to become a regional supply chain manager for a global company. However, I feel stuck with my resume, which has been shaped more by financial needs than by a clear career path. I work in Logistics for a global manufacturing firm on their North American supply chain team, with nearly 8 years of strong logistics experience, mostly with 3PL service providers. I've handled various domestic and international freight and have some warehouse/inventory management experience. While I want to advance in supply chain, I feel confined to logistics and lack leadership experience. My current role primarily supports outbound export shipments, along with inbound shipments and inventory management for our FTZ team. My company is undergoing significant changes, leading to high turnover in the supply chain team, including upper management. I had a supportive manager who is no longer with the company. Recently, I reached out to a former contact about an Operations Supervisor position at an LTL trucking company, and the conversation went well; I’m currently interviewing and expect an offer. It may involve a pay cut, which makes me hesitant, but I can manage financially. Should I take the Supervisor role at the LTL trucking company or try to navigate my current company's transition to move into a broader supply chain role in buying/planning/quality? Additionally, has anyone transitioned from LTL ops supervisor to ops manager and then to a regional/global supply chain manager role? Or is the LTL sector too specialized for such a move? Thank you for your time, and I appreciate any comments!",

I'm interested in those that provide a solid foundation in supply chain principles and cover advanced topics like digital transformation, sustainability, and global strategies. My aim is to broaden my industry understanding, stay current with trends, and improve my professional standing. I've found certifications like APICS CPIM, CSCP, and SCPro from CSCMP, each offering different benefits. I would appreciate insights from anyone who has pursued these or other supply chain certifications regarding: 1. Your experience with the certification process: How difficult was it? How much study time did you invest? 2. Its impact on your career: Did it lead to new job opportunities? How did it affect your credibility and industry knowledge? 3. Recommendations for someone with a few years in logistics: Which certification would you suggest for my background? 4. Preparation resources: Were there any specific books, courses, or materials you found particularly useful? Additionally, I'm interested in any emerging certifications focused on technology integration in supply chain management, as I believe this will be crucial moving forward. Thank you for sharing your experiences and advice; your input will greatly assist me in navigating my career in the supply chain field.",

  "content": "I've been reflecting on this and would like your input. It's clear that EVs aren't the long-term solution for vehicle power. Their batteries last only around 10 years and are costly to replace, charging infrastructure is lacking, and sourcing materials is becoming more difficult and expensive. Hydrogen seems more likely to prevail once it's proven safe and practical for consumers. So why are we offering tax incentives and other benefits for EV buyers? This frustrates me, especially since I work in supply chain. Many agree that EVs aren’t suitable for long-haul trucking due to the heavy batteries, inadequate charging infrastructure, and shorter battery life compared to diesel. Despite this, companies like Tesla continue to thrive—could it be due to Elon Musk's influence? I've come to wonder if the promotion of EVs is a strategy to curb Saudi wealth, as more EVs could mean reduced oil purchases from them. Musk has strong ties to the government and plays a key role in national security through his satellite operations. Is this support for EVs part of a broader strategy to limit financial dependency on Saudi Arabia? Today, I noticed they're finally facing financial losses, which sparked these thoughts. What do you think? EVs seem like a short-term government push with a global agenda while we seek better sustainable energy solutions.",

Key benefits of a solid inventory management strategy include:\n\n- **Organized Stock**: The first step in inventory management is organization, which streamlines customer service and ordering, ultimately saving time.\n\n- **Product Accuracy**: A well-organized inventory allows you to identify best-selling items, helping maintain a balanced stock without overextending space on low-demand products.\n\n- **Customer Retention and Acquisition**: Efficient inventory management enables prompt fulfillment of customer needs, increasing the likelihood of repeat purchases and generating new customers through word-of-mouth referrals.\n\n- **Time Efficiency**: Optimized and computerized inventory reduces the need for lengthy checks, making inventory control simpler and more automated.\n\n- **Cost Reduction**: Organized inventory management helps minimize expenses by avoiding overinvestment in slow-moving products.\n\n- **Enhanced Efficiency and Productivity**: Utilizing technology, such as barcode scanners and inventory software, significantly boosts business efficiency and productivity.",

  "content": "Ways to Decrease eCommerce Order Fulfillment Time: \n\n1. **Choose the Right Fulfillment Solution**: Select an appropriate fulfillment model to cut down on time and labor costs. Effective integration can save resources and reduce human errors. \n\n2. **Third-Party Fulfillment Partner (3PL)**: If your company lacks the capacity to fulfill orders, consider partnering with a 3PL. This option eliminates the need for fulfillment software, warehouse space, shipping interfaces, and additional staff. Ensure you understand your budget and business needs before selecting a suitable 3PL.\n\n3. **Dropshipping**: If you don’t stock or manufacture products, consider dropshipping. This method relies on manufacturers to produce, store, and ship products directly to customers.\n\n4. **Utilize Integration Solutions**: To fulfill orders quickly, maintain visibility across logistics, sales, and inventory. Real-time access to data is essential, and integrating platforms like your website, inventory system, shopping cart, warehouse management, CRM, and accounting software is crucial for meeting customer expectations.\n\n5. **Understand Your Cost Per Order**: Longer fulfillment times typically lead to higher costs due to disconnected systems, resulting in repeated data entry and comparisons across various applications.\n\n6. **Minimize the Impact of Order Returns**: Facilitating easy returns is vital for customer satisfaction in a competitive market. While it enhances engagement, high return rates can increase operational costs without generating revenue.",

  "content": "Hello everyone! At Descartes, we’ve been analyzing trends in home delivery and just completed our 2024 Home Delivery Sustainability Study. Given the changes in logistics and the global economy, we examined how consumer attitudes towards sustainability impact last-mile delivery. 57% of consumers are interested in sustainable delivery options, and an impressive 99% are willing to take further steps to reduce their carbon footprint. However, 89% noted that economic factors, like inflation, affect their ability to pay more for eco-friendly delivery. Additionally, 37% now consider convenience and sustainability equally when selecting delivery methods. A significant trend is the emergence of green delivery slots, which bundle multiple orders to minimize trips, thereby reducing emissions and costs; 56% of respondents are open to this approach. For last-mile providers, this could be an important innovation for environmental benefits and cost management. What are your thoughts? How is the last-mile sector evolving to achieve sustainability while managing costs? Are there any new technologies or processes that help you balance both? We’d love to hear from you! 🙌 If you're interested in exploring the full study, you can find it here:",

As an account coordinator at a 3PL, the volume of emails and last-minute problems can be overwhelming. Larger 3PLs provide some work-life balance with dedicated departments for after-hours issues, while smaller brokerages often expect near-constant availability. I earned about $64K, but the stress and off-hours calls were tiring. In contrast, being a logistics specialist on the customer side is less stressful. At smaller companies, the workload was manageable, and I rarely had to stay late or handle after-hours problems, but the pay was lower, around $45-$55K. While this role is more relaxed, it falls short of the $100K salary I aim for without moving into a rare managerial position. I’ve also worked in customs clearance, which involves similar constant updates and challenges, but the financial rewards are not significantly better. Overall, logistics is a demanding, undervalued industry, and the compensation reflects that. It’s tough to find well-paying roles without excessive hours. For those considering this field, be prepared for its challenges and limited financial rewards.",

We have a warehouse at our new office that stores all inventory for the maintenance and HVAC teams, including appliances for unit upgrades and turns. Currently, we lack an inventory management system, relying only on a person with a spreadsheet, which does not track who takes items or their whereabouts. I want to implement a QR-based system to scan items when they leave the warehouse (recording who takes them and removing them from 'warehouse inventory') and when installed at properties (adding to 'in-use inventory'). Each maintenance team member would have individual access, linking inventory to them. I also want to generate inventory reports to inform our purchasing agent of needs. I'm unsure if QR is the best solution, but it was suggested in a brainstorming session. I believe something similar exists, but I haven't found anything not focused on retail inventory management or overly complex with unnecessary features. Any guidance would be appreciated! Thanks!",

Moreover, we have various menus with differing pricing strategies, such as:\n- Raspberry Lemonade (GUID 12345): Main menu item\n- Raspberry Lemonade 16oz (GUID 12345-xx): Higher-priced version\n- Raspberry Lemonade 16oz (GUID 12345-xy): Standard-priced version\n\nAdditionally, guests can add extra syrups or creamers, and I need the system to track these modifiers accurately. Has anyone dealt with similar challenges? I would appreciate any tips or best practices for managing complex recipe variations and modifiers in MarketMan and Toast. Thank you!",

Our main challenge is the need to enter sales orders multiple times (technically three times by two people), and we aim to streamline this process. Our key requirements include: \n\n- Creating a lot code for each harvest. \n- Printing this lot code on shellfish tags, along with the harvest date, location, and customer name.\n- Generating tag information from sales orders and lot selections entered during the sales phase, eliminating the need for repeated entry.\n- Tracking inventory based on our harvests, which we consider as raw material production.\n- Aggregating daily sales orders into a list for washing and packing for shipment.\n- Sorting/filtering these aggregated lists by date, brand, shipping route, and customer to produce various pack-out and shipping lists.\n- Creating purchase orders.\n- Integrating with Quickbooks.\n- Generating Bills of Lading for shipments across the US and Canada.\n- Producing weekly and monthly reports for regulatory authorities based on harvest time/date/temperature, products received from other farms, and shipment fulfillment to ensure safety and traceability in case of issues.\n\nWe appreciate any suggestions or experiences. Our annual revenue exceeds $1 million, with a goal of 20% growth next year. This inventory software challenge is currently a barrier to that growth. We have considered Acctivate and Food Connex (from CAiSoft) but are hesitant to commit until we are confident it will meet our needs. Thank you!",

Your operation sounds really interesting, and I can see how managing such complex processes with your current tools can be a major bottleneck, especially with your goal of 20% growth.\n\n\n\nSince you’re dealing with both farm-produced and externally-sourced shellfish, it’s essential to have a system that not only simplifies order entry but also tracks inventory in real-time with full traceability. Your specific needs around lot code generation, sales order aggregation, and regulatory compliance make it clear that you need software built for complex workflows.\n\n\n\nHave you considered exploring systems that incorporate AI or machine learning for optimizing inventory tracking, lot management, and reporting? Some companies in the food and agriculture industries are turning to AI-driven solutions for automating manual data entry and improving traceability. These tools can even aggregate and analyze harvest and sales data, helping you make quicker and more accurate business decisions while keeping everything fully compliant with regulatory bodies.\n\n\n\nI’ve seen companies in similar spaces reduce manual entry and streamline operations by using more integrated solutions—this might help you eliminate that triple entry problem and improve overall efficiency. If you’d like, I could share some specific examples of how AI is being used in traceability and logistics, and how it could benefit shellfish operations like yours.\n\n\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on this or explore options if you’re interested. Feel free to DM me for more info, and I’d be happy to share ideas and insights tailored to your needs!",

While many CRMs allow data import via CSV files, my customer and sales order lists update frequently, and I need those changes reflected in the CRM quickly (ideally hourly).

I'd suggest this is at the front as it's going to be a massive timesaver to know where to head to begin with. \n\nFrom here I'd be looking at the next step once the worker gets to the right floor - where should they look next to quickly locate the part? If you have any other ways you can split up each room then this would be my next code to add in - could be color coding, or \"ikea style\" row and aisle or you might have category areas that you can lean on here.\n\nI'd try to keep the code as small as possible, but still contain all your key \"way finders\" above. It's essential you make them all consistent so that workers can learn how to decode them.\n\nOnce you have your code structure down, then you should start looking into how to label and track each part on the shelf - again, hundreds of possible options available here, but [this blog post here on bin locations has a couple of options](https://craftybase.com/blog/bin-location) (including using QR codes for simple scanning on mobile phones etc.)",

I have an idea to streamline our warehouse inventory and would like your feedback. Currently, we use ServiceTitan for all our needs (inventory, estimates, sales, client communication) and rely on pen and paper to inform our warehouse manager about additional parts stocked on our vans. He conducts periodic paper inventory checks. I'm considering a program to replace this system with a process involving barcodes, Google Forms, and Excel. The plan is for technicians to scan a QR code that leads to a Google Form with a list of parts, allowing them to photograph the barcode of the part they’re taking. This data would then populate an Excel file to track additional inventory beyond ServiceTitan. Is this an overly complicated idea, or could it work and has it been done before? I welcome both positive and negative feedback, technical terms, and any extra suggestions. Thank you for your help, and I’m happy to offer HVAC advice in return.",

Otherwise you are syncing 2 databases.\n\nYou mention QR codes; they might be more than you need. A QR code is good to represent very long text strings such as URLs. A barcode is easier to generate. \n\nI would use a scanner rather than a phone. They are quicker to use. A 2d (2 dimension) scanner can scan barcodes and QR codes into the spreadsheet \n\nA QR code can take them to a website that has the inventory list in it (eg a google or shared excel sheet). The user can then  see how many parts there are (eg part123) and scan out ones he/she is taking. \n\nI think you would only want a QR code to point to the inventory list of there are lots of spreadsheets to choose from. I assume there would be only one inventory list in a know website location  \n\nIf you just want to replace the pen and paper with excel or google, that is easy. You can scan items into, and out of, the spreadsheet and have the sheet broadcast to many people so they can see a live copy \n\nAn example is in the link below (the sheet can be in excel or google, and the excel can be shared so everyone can see it, like a google sheet)\n\n[https://www.improvingyoursmallbusiness.com/inventory/](https://www.improvingyoursmallbusiness.com/inventory/)\n\nI would think through first the need for data to flow between ServiceTian and the warehouse inventory. If no need, then yes, you can create a warehouse spreadsheet. \n\nFeel free to post questions.",

It eliminates the need to remember urls, and can also be used to direct the user to the exact place on your website they need to access, to record what they need to. A solution like this can be added on to your existing website or hosted separately, with any kind of authentication required.  \n  \nAs part of the initial set up, when someone scans the QR for the first time, they can be asked to enter their details in a form that will record who they are and make the process a lot easier for them at any subsequent login by recording their credentials in local storage so that the system recognises them the next time they need to use it.  \n  \nOnce they arrive at the correct url, they will then be able to scan barcodes corresponding to whatever parts they're picking on their phones, which is the least expensive option given that everyone has a phone, which is stored in a database together with the details of the user, and time and date.  \n  \nThis data can then be downloaded as a csv for further use, manipulation and analysis by date range or any other criteria you wish. If you really want to use Google Sheets instead of a downloadable csv, then that can also be easily achieved by integration with Google Sheets.\n\nThe other thing you need to remember is the bit where you need to create the barcodes and assign them to individual parts.\n\nBased on this overview, I think you're idea is solid.

  "content": "I run a small business with two retail locations selling snacks, candy, drinks, and cookies, managing over 500 SKUs and using Shopify for POS and inventory. I'm not satisfied with Shopify and am considering switching to KORONA POS, which has a better inventory management system that allows for expiration date tracking. I want to hire someone to handle inventory management, which includes: 1. Analyzing inventory to identify sales trends and product needs by location, and determining how much to stock. 2. Placing weekly orders with vendors for all locations. 3. Coordinating with retail staff to receive and input inventory into the POS. 4. Managing vendor relationships, with some involvement on my part. This is my first time hiring for this role, so I’m unsure whether to look for an inventory manager or specialist, and what the typical salary is. Can I hire someone entry-level who can learn, or do I need someone with 1-2 years of experience? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",

In our warehouse we use a simple bin system where the picking workorder has Qty, Sku, Product Name and warehouse bin number.  We can search our inventory by sku or bin number.  Every product also has a product code which is our internal database number.  This number never changes so we can change sku, bin #s or barcodes w/o affecting all the other info associated with the internal product code like product name, inventory level, stock on order, historical sales, vendors, cost, pricing, descriptions, SEO data, etc.\n\nWe do use a 3PL for some items that are barcoded but barcodes definitely do not need to be the same as the sku number.  If you want them to be fine, but that is simply personal preference and won't really affect most inventory systems.  At our 3PL we have multiple mfg bar codes mapped a single sku for a number of products that have more than one source.  The 3PL software easily handles this, we simply enter all possible mfg barcodes for a given sku.\n\nThe most important number IMHO is to have a static database number.  All the stuff around and linked to this number like barcode numbers can change, even the sku or product name, but you need to have a fixed database number for a product that the system can point everything to that should be related to that product.",

Since both sites share resources, I want a system to distinguish each site's inventory while also providing total counts for ordering purposes.

We've been using a poor homemade Excel sheet, so I'm looking for a template to simplify the process. I need it to track item names, descriptions, and quantities on hand, plus a section for received items, with automatic calculations for necessary purchases based on a minimum level. Including images of the items would be helpful. We don't use item numbers or prices since the purchaser orders the cheapest options from various sources. I could create this myself, but I'm out of ideas and would prefer a premade solution that I can quickly customize. Any recommendations?",

  "content": "I work for a small retail business that sells both in-store and online, frequently ordering products from various suppliers. Upon receiving items, I contact them for a spreadsheet with barcode numbers, style numbers, colors, sizes, titles, descriptions, and available images. I can’t be the only retailer making such requests, especially with many people listing products online or using inventory systems that require this information. It's common to see identical descriptions and titles across different websites, indicating wholesalers provide the same details to retailers. Yet, when I reach out, representatives often seem surprised by my request, needing multiple transfers to possibly locate a “download as .xlsx or .csv” option for my order. Why is this process so cumbersome? Surely larger retailers like Walmart don’t manually copy product details for every new item. While I'm aware of EDI systems that automate inventory for big companies, I don’t think I need one to obtain a simple spreadsheet for my small business. Currently, I’m manually entering about 90% of the required information, typing style numbers without digital invoices, or copying them from invoices one at a time, then scanning barcodes as items arrive. Each supplier has its own procedures, making it hard to track them all—some provide a master product spreadsheet via Dropbox, others offer just a digital invoice or packing slip. Every supplier presents a unique challenge. There must be a more efficient way to handle this.",

  "content": "Hello everyone, I’m digitizing the inventory and order management system for a small vegetable warehouse currently using paper. They supply vegetables to schools and smaller institutions, with many recurring clients. I’m seeking software suggestions to streamline operations. Here’s a brief overview of the requirements and a typical scenario: \n\nBackground: I’m mainly a frontend developer and can customize a solution's frontend as needed. I’ve thought about building a system from scratch using a headless CMS like Strapi, but I’m also looking for simpler options. I’ve reviewed systems like Odoo and ERPNext but welcome additional recommendations.\n\nRequirements: \n1. Self-Hosted or Local: Must operate locally on a PC or be self-hosted. \n2. Inventory Management: Should manage stock like 250 kg of potatoes, 40 kg of tomatoes, etc. \n3. Order Management: Need to easily create phone orders in the system. \n4. Recurring Clients: Must save client info for automatic invoice inclusion. \n5. Invoice Generation: System should produce detailed invoices post-checkout, including items, quantities, prices, and custom fields. \n6. Printing Capability: Should allow direct printing of invoices. \n7. Ease of Use: Must be user-friendly for those with minimal tech skills. \n8. Open Source and Cost-Effective: Preferably open-source for customization without ongoing costs.\n\nScenario Example: An order is received by phone. The operator inputs the details (e.g., 250kg of potatoes, 40kg of tomatoes, 10kg of onions), then checks out, resulting in an invoice that lists all items, prices, and client-specific information. I appreciate any advice or experiences you can share, especially regarding similar systems.",

  "content": "After a year with inFlow, we're ready to leave. I run a small D2C airsoft brand using a 3PL, and last year we needed an MRP/inventory management solution due to tracking difficulties. With only a three-person team, a costly custom solution wasn't feasible, so I researched 15 MRP/ERP options, prioritizing a modern UI/UX and Shopify integration. We chose inFlow, paying €350/month, which is steep for us, but we hoped for a quality product. Onboarding was easy, and their label printing software is impressive.\n\nHowever, I overlooked a critical detail: imported sales orders from Shopify were sourced from random locations due to a setup issue. With only two locations—our 3PL warehouse and our office—this led to significant inventory inaccuracies, which we initially misattributed to our own errors. After five months of back-and-forth with customer support, we learned that inFlow's Shopify integration is flawed for app-based locations. They blamed our use of a third-party app, despite it being widely used and compliant with Shopify's Fulfillment API.\n\nThe main issue is that their app lacks the necessary permission scope and requires an update, which they have not prioritized. Even suggesting a simple fix was ignored. Although we requested a discount for our troubles, we were offered a mere 10% reduction and an upsell to an annual plan. A co-founder acknowledged our frustrations but offered no solutions. \n\nAdditionally, there’s a separate unresolved bug where new product categories are automatically visible to all B2B customers, necessitating manual adjustments for each account. Despite these critical flaws, the rest of the product is solid. However, the lack of support and urgency for fixes has ruined our experience. We must find a new solution, as inFlow has shown no commitment to addressing our issues. This serves as a warning to potential users: they may not address your concerns.",

We need a system that tracks expiration dates and lot numbers, with alerts for nearing expirations. It should work with our existing scannable labels (QR codes, mini-barcodes) to avoid printing new ones. Ideally, the system would enable real-time tracking for multiple users, allowing us to scan items during patient management, preferably with an app component.

  "content": "I began working at a grocery distribution center that uses pen, paper, and Excel spreadsheets. They want to track inventory from inbound bulk deliveries to outbound shipments to wholesale and retail stores, requiring a point of sale system that can manage and separate inventory. Since they handle groceries, existing SKUs simplify tracking, but they also use QR codes as they primarily produce eggs, tagging and weighing each box upon arrival. I'm seeking a solution to manage multiple store and warehouse locations with units of measure in cases, boxes, and weights, including QR/barcode scanning (an app would be ideal, but handheld devices or scanners are also acceptable). The system should provide real-time inventory tracking on iOS, Android, Mac, and Windows, with point of sale capabilities available or linked to another service, and be scalable for future online sales. Additionally, while not directly related, we currently have a basic real-time delivery truck tracking system and are considering an upgrade. The company is small, but the volume is significant, so I'm looking for small to medium enterprise solutions, as most options I’ve encountered are quite large.",

We currently rely on temporary staff to enter high volumes of wine sample data into Excel (supplier, varietal, vintage, etc.). I want a more efficient, scalable system, ideally one that uses barcode scanning and cataloging. However, some samples lack barcodes (due to supplier labels or tank samples). Requirements: Ability to scan bottles with barcodes to log their details, including inventory date and storage location, and create a catalog (similar to a spreadsheet of samples); ability to manually enter non-barcode samples (preferably with a feature to print unique barcodes for easy scanning out); ability to scan out samples sent to customers to track receipt and dispatch details. An app would be ideal for team access to the inventory. Any recommendations would be appreciated!",

When you interview businesses who might benefit from your software product, you should ask them. \n\n1. What is the core problem you would like a software solution for inventory to solve for your business?\n2. Can you tell me the story of what happened that led you to look for a solution to the problem you encountered? \n\nWhen you ask the client - what the problem is and how it began and what is the journey of pain leading to looking for a solution, you have a framework for what to build your software around. If you ask this question and more say similar stories you might see trends which indicates a hole exists in the market. \n\nAs you go about this process - you’ll discover things. \n\nYou might find that spreadsheets is the top level problem. But as you dig deeper you will find more. \n\nI did this research early on with clients. \n\n1. Spreadsheets don’t scale\n2. They don’t offer real time inventory since they aren’t updated on time.\n3. Only 1 person knows the formulas and if he gets hit by a bus the business is done \n……\n\n\nDig deeper and you find out more to the problems beyond the surface when you talk to business owners. \n1. Spreadsheets don’t scale when I’m hiring people and everybody is trying to update the spreadsheets we use and some forget or do it wrong… \n2. I forgot to update the inventory once and ran out of stock of an item with a 3 month lead time and lost 10k in sales because I couldn’t fulfill orders. Crested bad reputation in my market because of it. \n3. I the business owner am fixing all the bad spreadsheet formulas and I cant spend time focusing on growing my business…. \n\n\nOkay - so now we are getting somewhere. Features are supposed to create a solution that makes them better than spreadsheets, but they must also make a solution that solves a business problem that affects the company…. \n\nWhen you dig deeper, find the stories of the clients that suffer and make that your mission to solve the client problem there, don’t get too lost in the technicalities. \n\nHope that helps :)",

  "content": "The title summarizes my situation: I'm the IT guy at a medium-sized company and recently purchased inventory management software that lets me create pre-designed labels for my stock. I also bought a Brother QL-820 series label printer with an official Brother thermal paper roll, but it’s not laminated and fades over time. While my handheld Brother label maker, used for labeling cables, has a plastic layer that prevents fading, I currently use transparent tape over the labels as a temporary fix. However, I want a solution that simplifies my work. I've reached out to local office suppliers, but none carry 62mm continuous laminated rolls of paper, and I'm unsure if they even exist. Any suggestions?",

I work for a company that sells sports gear online and in two retail locations.

We lack a solid inventory tracking system, resulting in situations where our partner sells items we don't have, often without prior notice. My boss and he are looking for software to track product quantities across our two retail locations, one Shopify store, and one Amazon store. Additionally, the items we need to track currently don't share matching SKUs online. I can address that but prefer software that can handle one item with multiple SKUs. Furthermore, I don't think our retail products have proper barcodes for scanning, so any advice on that would be appreciated. I apologize if this is overwhelming or seems impossible; I inherited this from someone less informed, so any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

If so, what system? \n\nIt sounds like you’ll need some key features from the inventory management solutions.\n\n1. Multi-location inventory tracking\n2. Shopify and Amazon integrations that support order pull, order fulfillment sync, order routing to location and stock sync\n3. Possibly POS integration - but if you Shopify POS then that’s a great option (I know katana supports this very well too)\n4. You probably will have other apps/tools to integrate into your stack which are biz critical (like accounting)\n\nWhat is your total SKU count? It’s going to become important to get SKUs matching. I think there are certain use-cases where you might need to use an alternative SKU for Amazon and may need a 3rd party integrator to help manage this to bridge with a cloud inventory solution… \n\nOtherwise, it is highly advised you have SKUs match between your IMS, Ecomm, POS and Amazon if possible. This is usually necessary because Stock syncs are typically designed to work based on SKU matching. \n\nHope that helps",

It will streamline your operations across all your sales channels (physical stores, Shopify, and your partner's Amazon store). Here's what to look for:\n\nMulti-location Tracking: The software should track inventory levels across all your locations in real time. This eliminates stock-outs and ensures you can fulfill orders accurately.\n\nMultiple SKU Support: Many systems can handle products with different SKUs on various platforms. This saves you the hassle of constantly updating SKUs and ensures accurate data.\n\nBarcode Integration: Barcode scanning is a game-changer for efficient inventory management. Look for software that integrates with barcode scanners for faster and more accurate stock updates.\n\nI've had success using GEP’s supply chain software for complete inventory management. It's been particularly helpful with mostly all the pain points you've mentioned.\n\n\nHaving said that, the best solution depends on your budget, team size, and specific needs. \n\n\nIt might be worth exploring demos or trials of some options to see what fits best! You can also check out the Gartner, Forrester, and ISG reports. They rank all the top software and it’s a good starting point for figuring out what’s what. ",

  "content": "This is probably my first time using Reddit for advice on a real-life issue (usually it's for gaming). Here’s my situation: A few months ago, I began working at a coffee roasting factory with 11 production lines, 5 roasters, 6 grinders, 3 daily shifts (plus one on weekends), and nearly 100 operators. I serve as the supply chain administrative assistant, handling daily production reports, planning support, operator clothing, invoicing, and basic inventory tracking. Recently, my boss requested that we start a tool inventory, and after learning the process, I found it outdated and very time-consuming, with no effective tracking. The last inventory was done months ago (the previous assistant was fired), and operators frequently “misplace” tools. I want to propose a new method to streamline tool inventory management and hold operators somewhat accountable. Here’s what I know: \n\n1. Each production line has a specific tool kit, with some tools for general use. \n2. Operators can carry a small bag for minor tools; they might fit more tools in there or we could provide better bags. \n3. We currently use a simple spreadsheet for inventory. \n4. I have a list of tools for each line to identify common and specific items. \n5. I lack clearance for surveillance cameras, and there’s little interest in tracking tool misplacements due to resource constraints. \n6. Missing tools are simply replaced, but my boss and the maintenance team are frustrated with this approach. \n7. Most operators have been with the company for over five years, which may help with solutions.\n\nI’m considering creating a “common tool kit” for every operator and a “specific tool kit” for each production line, but this won't fully resolve the misplacement issue. How should I approach this? What am I overlooking? I need ideas for a plan to present, as I have approval to test my proposal on one of the largest lines. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Let me know if you need more details; I'm happy to provide them. Apologies for any mistakes; English isn't my first language.",

Sort (Seiri): The first step is to sort through all items in the manufacturing area and remove any unnecessary or unused items. This helps to reduce clutter and create more space for essential items.\n\n2. Set in Order (Seiton): Once unnecessary items have been removed, the next step is to organize the remaining items in a logical and efficient manner. This involves assigning specific locations for each item and ensuring that they are easily accessible to workers when needed.\n\n3. Shine (Seiso): This step involves thoroughly cleaning the manufacturing area, including equipment, tools, and work surfaces. Regular cleaning helps to maintain a safe and hygienic work environment.\n\n4. Standardize (Seiketsu): Standardization involves establishing clear guidelines and procedures for maintaining the organized and clean manufacturing area. This includes creating visual cues, such as labels or signs, to indicate the proper location for each item.\n\n5. Sustain (Shitsuke): The final step is to sustain the \"everything in its place\" principle by regularly reviewing and maintaining the organized state of the manufacturing area. This involves training employees on the importance of organization and cleanliness and conducting regular audits to ensure compliance.\n\nBy implementing the \"everything in its place\" principle and following the 5S methodology, manufacturers can create a more efficient and productive work environment, reduce waste and errors, and improve overall safety and quality.",

I.e. tracking data in spreadsheets - I recommend the cloud based ones (Airtable, Monday, etc...) so that you can get a handle on what is accurate and what is not within your ERP system. Once you can real inventory in your secondary system, I recommend working with your finance team to put together a cleanup plan for your ERP. Usually if you can work with your accounting/finance team that will give you the power to make changes to your company's systems",

  "content": "I have recently been assigned to manage a new small business that assembles large finished products for customers. Since the company is just starting out, there are no established processes or systems, and I want to set up a strong foundation for future growth. I lack inventory experience, so this is my first time handling such responsibilities. \n\nThe business needs to assemble about 5-10 large products each month, using approximately 40 pieces of raw materials for each finished product. While this volume is manageable, it is expected to grow quickly. Therefore, I need a system to track inventory, including beginning inventory, purchases, work in progress, finished goods, and ending inventory. I am considering a barcoding system with SKUs to streamline this process. With around 40-50 types of raw materials, I can assign barcodes to each location. At the end of each day or week, an employee can scan the barcodes and log the quantities, allowing for easy conversion to a spreadsheet or system. I’m looking for feedback on this idea, as I believe it could simplify inventory management and reduce manual counting.\n\nWhile I am proficient in Excel and can start tracking inventory there, I believe that for long-term success and growth, it would be beneficial to implement dedicated inventory software. I welcome any questions or suggestions as I navigate this learning process.",

It should allow students to check in and out books easily, requiring only their name and email, ideally through a simple website where they can enter the book title or our SKU for easier input than an ISBN; 3. It needs to be easy to maintain since I’ll be transitioning it to others when I leave at the end of next year. If anyone knows of software that fits these criteria, please let me know. While most platforms offer extra features we don’t need, a basic functional system would be sufficient. Additionally, it will be a self-service system, so students will independently check out and return their books.",

Here are some I think can help you:\r\r\n\n**1. Odoo Inventory:**\n\nIt's user friendly and can handle tasks like tracking inventory levels, managing shipments, and integrating with e-commerce platforms.\r\n\nIt offers a double-entry inventory system. It's possible to track every stock movement from purchase to warehouse bin to sales order. Track lots or serial numbers upstream or downstream.\r\n\nIt offers a free plan for basic inventory features but if you want more advanced ones, you'll need to pay. I think as your business grows, you can do that.\r\n\n**2. inFlow Inventory:**\n\nIt offers in-depth product tracking, extensive order management, and a comprehensive multi-location management system.\r\n\nIt offers a free version with a limited number of products. If you want more advanced features and support, you need to upgrade to their paid plans.\r\n\n**3. Zoho Inventory:**\n\nIt helps you track stock levels, manage orders, and integrate with other Zoho applications and more.\r\n\nIt offers a mobile app and a free plan with basic features.\r  \n\r  \n**4. QuickBooks:**\n\nIt's user-friendly and popular among small and midsize businesses. It offers inventory tracking features that let you monitor stock levels, manage purchase orders, generate reports, track expenses, sales and more.\r\n\nWhile it offers a free trial, it's a paid service.\r\n\nYou can also use CRMs for basic inventory management to scale your business like Monday that combines customer and inventory management. Asana and Salesforce can also be helpful for that.\r\n\nThey may not have full-on management inventory features but they still can help. You can check out their communities here on Reddit and ask about more specific ways they can help you with inventory.",

I've been told to pause software changes due to internal issues. I might reach out to some of you later. Thank you.",

Barcoding will naturally help facilitate all this.\n\nIf it is truly like a thirft store and everything is unique one offs, this would get ugly fast.

Currently, we use Google Sheets to manually log when we produce a flavor, when it ships to another store, and when it's used. Since Google Sheets isn't very intuitive, we're seeking a better solution, possibly something akin to warehouse management. \n\nWe want the kitchen to log ice cream production using a QR code that updates the stock in the system as it's stored in the freezer. When stores need to order ice cream, the kitchen will scan the flavors being shipped. Upon delivery, the store will scan the received flavors, and when they sell a flavor, they will scan the QR code again. The QR code will help track production date and the entire process. \n\nCan an inventory management app address this? Any suggestions? Budget isn’t an issue; we're just looking for a solution to streamline the process. We might consider building an app, but I hope to find an existing one that we can customize. Thanks in advance!",

To give some background, we own an antique shop where most sales occur online across multiple platforms, including eBay, Etsy, Chairish, and Shopify. We use Sellbrite for listings but must post separately to Chairish since it doesn’t sync. Currently, we manage inventory with Sortly but want to switch to a platform that handles both inventory management and consignor tracking, as we are beginning to take on more consignments. We need software that can track consignors, match inventory to them, and store relevant documents. One option we found is ConsignCloud, which offers robust inventory tracking and consignment management but doesn’t sync with Sellbrite. This isn’t a deal-breaker, as we could still use it for tracking items and consignors while managing listings through Sellbrite. I’m posting to see if anyone has similar experiences or advice. We’ve searched for IMS/Consignment software that syncs with Sellbrite but found nothing. We’re open to suggestions for improving our consignment and inventory management, as our current system feels patchy. Ideally, we’d like a single system that can post listings, track inventory locations, and manage consignments, though we haven’t found one at a viable price. We appreciate any insights or experiences you can share. Thank you!",

  "title": "What are the solutions to the most common inventory management issues?",
  "content": "In 2020, modern businesses have recognized the necessity of inventory management software for running an efficient phone repair shop. In a competitive market, repair store owners cannot afford to waste money. Let's explore common inventory management challenges and how POS software can help address them. \n\nChallenge 1: Unknown Inventory \nUnderstanding essential versus non-essential items and their ordering timelines is crucial. Essential items are those that are popular or sold year-round and require constant restocking. Identifying core items is just the start; you must also know what’s in stock, what needs ordering, and what requires restocking. Managing inventory can be overwhelming but is essential for profitability, and a quality POS system can assist greatly.\n\nChallenge 2: Manual Inventory Tracking \nMany businesses begin with manual inventory tracking, like spreadsheets. However, this method becomes problematic for larger businesses with multiple outlets, leading to unreliable real-time information and inaccurate counts. Such inaccuracies can result in excess or insufficient inventory, causing customer dissatisfaction. Automating through POS software is the optimal solution, providing real-time tracking, low-stock alerts, inventory counts, reorder notifications, and quick purchase orders.\n\nChallenge 3: Decentralized Inventory Records \nCentralizing inventory allows management from one location for all repair stores, enhancing control over operations like reordering and receiving. This efficiency simplifies managing multi-channel orders and inventory levels, improving customer experience through accurate product information and stock availability.\n\nChallenge 4: Lack of Transparency \nIBM reports that 79% of store owners find lack of transparency significantly impacts profits. Today’s businesses prioritize transparency in operations, ensuring employees and customers are informed about item statuses. Even with solid inventory strategies, issues may arise, so keeping customers updated on order delays can adjust their expectations and maintain confidence. Clear communication is vital, including notifying customers when items are back in stock.\n\nThe Solution: Cloud-Based Inventory Management & Repair Store Software \nAn effective inventory management system is now a reality. If you haven't selected a POS software for your repair store, consider investing in automated inventory control to eliminate manual tasks and enhance efficiency. A smart inventory management solution provides real-time data access, enabling valuable insights for better forecasting and streamlining processes—making inventory management simpler through automation.",

With around 400 SKUs, most of which have low quantities, my inventory is consistently changing. Other departments have designated personnel for this, but it doesn't align with my area. We receive daily replenishments based on an automated system, and I need to ensure that our physical inventory matches the management system. I created a cycle count schedule to perform a full inventory count roughly every month (every 20 business days). What is a suitable frequency for cycle counts? More frequent counts lead to greater accuracy, but my time is limited due to my other responsibilities. If inventory discrepancies arise, production can be disrupted since automated replenishments won't trigger unless inventory levels drop below a certain percentage of maximum capacity (excluding broken or scrapped items). I'm seeking insights from anyone experienced in managing production inventories. TL;DR: How often should I conduct cycle counts if my company lacks established standards? Monthly? Quarterly?",

My employer has a 3 month full warehouse count that repeats, every 3 months. As you count more and more of the same product you get better at counting/seeing what is/isn't moving. Also the level that the auto-order activates can usually be modified up or down, which is useful if you can clearly see a consistant low stock of a high demand/ important item. My company is more of a retail based not production, we don't \"make\" anything but we fill orders for people on tight/costly schedules. I hope this helps, good luck!",

  "content": "Inventory is essential for retail businesses, and effective management is crucial. Poor inventory management is a leading cause of small business failures, often due to a series of errors resulting in poor decisions. In competitive markets with tight margins, small businesses cannot afford such mistakes. Overestimating demand leads to excess inventory, incurring storage costs and risking spoilage or obsolescence, while underestimating frustrates customers who may seek alternatives. Accurate demand forecasting is challenging, but without current and precise data, success is unlikely. Many small business owners still rely on pen-and-paper or spreadsheets for inventory tracking, which is prone to data-entry errors causing costly shipping mistakes and flawed forecasting. \n\nPoint-of-sale software offers accuracy, but small businesses hesitate to invest in technology like barcode scanners or RFID tags. If inventory data is inaccurate, resource planning becomes ineffective. Although inventory software can be costly, competitive software vendors provide appealing solutions for small businesses. Cloud-based inventory software enables real-time stock visibility across multiple locations, with dashboards for easy information visualization accessible from PCs or mobile devices. It can integrate with ERP systems for improved forecasting and support online sales, allowing customers to check product availability.\n\nAs retailers grow, cloud-based software can adapt seamlessly to new shippers or scanning systems. While these systems are user-friendly post-setup, deciding on features and integration can be complex. Modern omnichannel strategies require diverse technologies for mobility, social media, logistics, and analytics, often beyond the capacity of typical retail IT teams, leading to increased outsourcing. Effective inventory management is vital for retail success. Retailers are investing in cloud-based software and expert assistance to improve systems, using a combination of barcode and RFID technologies to enhance forecasts and reduce costs.",

  "content": "I have been free of fraud issues for nearly three years, which I took pride in. However, I recently let my guard down. While I managed to prevent an attempted freight theft before it escalated, a reputable carrier has fallen victim to a fraudulent FreightGuard report on Carrier411, jeopardizing their business. Here’s the story: We had a reefer load from NE to TX, and my operations manager received a call from VOKHID TRANSPORTATION MC 1226568 DOT 3573700. They provided the driver's name, contact info, truck, and trailer number—all necessary for checking in at the shipper. Although something felt off, the driver accepted tracking, so my ops guy confirmed the ETA and proceeded. The driver checked in at the shipper (drop trailer) but was delayed. The next day, issues arose with the trailer number, which raised suspicions, but since the truck and driver matched, I decided to monitor the load closely. An hour later, I noticed the truck was heading West instead of South, prompting me to call the driver. During our conversation, I discovered the driver wasn't with GOSMART, and the dispatcher had received a rate confirmation from THOR XPRESS 3PL MC 601820, which was a victim of identity theft. I verified my suspicions with them and provided documentation to resolve their issues. The driver had also been contacted by a fraudster impersonating Thor Xpress, claiming the load was rerouted to a Target in Fontana, CA, with cash payment at delivery. After some prodding, the driver gave me their company info, JDS Trans MC 870454. Language barriers made this challenging, but I contacted JDS Trans, informed them of the situation, and they shared their correspondence with the fraudster, allowing us to steer them in the right direction. Fortunately, we prevented the load theft, but soon after, they received a FreightGuard report from ACE TRUCKLOAD, LLC, attributed to a Jane Watson. The report falsely accused them of stealing freight. The first phone number listed was inactive, while the second one was verified but did not confirm Jane Watson's existence. After following up with ACE Truckload, I learned they had removed the report, suspecting their Carrier411 account was hacked. I emailed the address on the report but received no reply. Notably, the fraudster had been posting this load on DAT and engaging with them since 10/28, prior to",

  "content": "Here are some personal insights on how the coming months may disrupt the freight market significantly and quickly reduce current overcapacity. I welcome your thoughts. \n\n1. Proposed tariffs by Trump on Chinese products in January may prompt manufacturers to import more goods now to avoid extra taxes once tariffs are implemented, leading to unexpected volume increases in an already tight holiday market. \n2. Trump has indicated he will influence interest rates, meaning cuts may not solely rely on economic factors but also on his preferences. This could lead to lower interest rates, increasing money circulation and freight demand. \n3. Many illegal drivers and Mexican carriers taking low-paying loads may leave the U.S. trucking system before or when Trump takes office, as ICE is expected to intensify deportation efforts, raising the likelihood of police stops. \n4. Legal immigrants may also avoid trucking due to concerns that certain violations on a CDL could jeopardize their chances of obtaining a green card or citizenship, making the risks of trucking too high compared to a regular 9-5 job, further reducing capacity. \n5. Historically, many operators exit the market during winter due to financial strain, as they are often just one breakdown away from bankruptcy.",

      "author": "VigilantTransSvcs",
      "body": "I don't see this coming to pass... 2 months ago, I would have agreed the market swing was headed back into carriers favor in terms of rates.  FMCSA's new Registration Fraud Squad is expected to revoke over 6k carrier and broker authorities that currently do not meet federal compliance rules.  41k other brokers and carriers have questionable data regarding their compliance status, thus they also risk losing their authorities.  In late November, carriers that are not complaint under the Clearinghouse regulations will have their CDL's downgraded, affecting approximately 171k drivers, dramatically reducing capacity in the market.  The exit of these stakeholders due to enforcement of federal regulations will alone bring the market back into balance.  The upcoming Trump administration is poised to throw a curveball at this turn, and possibly drive us back into a freight recession.  The question is going to be if the reduction in carriers and brokers in the market will overpower the reduction in freight (imports since we are consumer based market instead of a production based market) that is coming from the implementation of the incoming administration's promise of new tariffs against all countries.  If we are counting on US production to counter the reduction of imports, it will take literally 5 or more years to move backwards in our economy... We have to build more plants, source more raw materials in US borders, find more labor to work in these plants once they are built.  This will not be an overnight effort.  It will not even be able to be accomplished in one presidential term. We will see in about 6 months if revocation of non-complaint authorities and downgrades of non-complaint CDL holders will have a strong enough impact to overcome the economic damage to the freight market from new tariffs.\n\nPoint 1 - The proposed tariffs will reduce imports when they go into effect.  If they go into effect in January, it is already too late to order foreign goods to arrive and clear customs in time to avoid the tariffs.  There will be no \"pre-administration freight surge\" as OP suggests.  It takes 2 weeks to cross the Pacific, another month to get into the port at Long Beach to unload.  That leaves 3 weeks for orders to be placed, manufactured, and loaded onto ships.  This is not very likely to happen that fast.  That means that Trump tariffs will actually cause an inflationary impact on the US economy, and cause a reduction in supply of goods with a stationary demand for those goods, AKA inflation, and a reduction in overall freight as the US cannot produce the quantities of goods at a pace that is needed to keep up with demand in place of import reductions.\n\nPoint 2 - As stated before, Trump has no power over the Federal Reserve.  He may appoint a successor to the Chairmanship in 2026, and the nominee may be fiercely loyal to Trump. but the board members vote on monetary policy, and the Chairman cannot override a majority vote.  Trump only has control over Fiscal Policy, by increasing or reducing government spending in proposals that must be approved by Congress.  The executive branch cannot spend a dime without the funds being allocated by Congress into specific buckets, where what those buckets can purchase is dictated by federal law (the annual spending bills, not by executive discretion).\n\nPoint 3 - Deportations were higher under Biden than under Trump in his first term.  We will see what immigration policy will be once Trump takes office.  I'm not counting on immigration policy to impact trucking unless new identification and CDL rules are put into place by Congress.  After that, Congress must empower DOT to increase funding for enforcement.  Until changes happen to 49 CFR and new funding is made available for enforcement by DOT, or even by DHS.  Either way, Congress needs to act before the Executive can take steps to execute these policies.\n\nPoint 4 - I mostly agree with this, but it still requires Congress to increase funding to DOT and DHS to increase enforcement.  If a driver (illegal immigrant or US born citizen) is driving safely, maintaining their equipment properly, and is not acting suspicious, the odds of them getting pulled over for a random inspection is slim to none.  The only way this will work is if a nationwide network of checkpoints is established to do a level 3 inspection on every single truck crossing that checkpoint which is not only impractical, but no law enforcement agency has the staffing or funding to undertake such an effort.\n\nPoint 5 - I agree that there is a seasonal reduction in capacity as some carriers don't run in the winter.  This supports rate surges in the Pacific NW, mountains, midwest, and northeast.  The South will continue to see low rates, if not lower rates with carriers who stay running stay south to avoid the snow leading to excess capacity in these regions.",

I'm committed to this role, seeing the potential rewards outweigh the risks, and I can leverage the training for another position in the industry once my non-compete expires. I’m fresh out of school with a logistics and supply chain background, and I’ve wanted to pursue this career since changing my major in my sophomore year. I understand the turnover and potential for “bullying,” but these challenges motivate me to prepare thoroughly for my first day. I aim to surpass my peers in training by absorbing as much knowledge as possible. I recognize that many complaints about this company come from carriers frustrated with its perceived lack of consideration and industry knowledge. I’m dedicated to this job and willing to put in extra hours to succeed. I want to communicate with carriers like a knowledgeable broker, not just a novice on the phone. To achieve this, I’ve been immersing myself in online resources about cold calling and thriving in high-pressure situations. I believe I will get out of this role what I put in, and I’m determined to invest fully because I want to succeed. I’m reaching out to experienced brokers for advice and insights, as I prefer connecting with real industry professionals over just watching videos. I plan to use LinkedIn more actively closer to my start date, once I have my title and a headshot. My intention isn’t to appear entitled; I simply want to work hard and would appreciate any opportunity to learn from others.",

You will be a kid on the phone until you aren't. Thats just the business. The goal isn't to make the carriers rich, its to make the company you work for rich. The better you get, the more you make. It's that simple. The other side of that coin is how long you want to do it for. Not a ton of loyalty in this industry so being a nice guy and being friendly don't get you very far. You can grind and put in the work all you want but it won't equal success. You seem to mean well but its like trying to learn how to use the grill before starting at Burger King. All the \"training\" means nothing until you flip the first burger. \n\nAlso, if its TQL, good luck lol",

  "content": "I've completed 3 loads for a 3PL, and my authority is almost 3 months old. This morning, 3PL contacted me about a dedicated lane opportunity paying $4.59/mile one way, or $2.29/mile with a deadhead back ($900 daily for under 200 miles with a 26' box truck), Monday to Friday. A third-party company will be the direct contact, and I need to send them photos of my truck and ID. If approved and I accept the contract, I must pay a one-time fee equal to my daily rate ($900). The 3PL rep called from their number but won't provide email verification, and I can't reach anyone by phone to confirm his identity. The third-party email had a spelling error, and I can't find their website or phone number online. The rate seems high, and the situation feels odd, yet they seem legitimate. This could be a significant opportunity for me, but I'm unsure about sending my truck and driver's license photos. The third party says they can get my W9 and insurance from 3PL, which makes me suspect. If it’s legit and I fail to meet the contract terms, how could it affect my MC? My truck has an engine light on, minor leaks, and a slight odor from patching the leaks, but they want a \"clean truck with no odor.\" The third party warned that failing to honor the contract could \"hurt my MC.\" Thanks for your help.",

I've worked for two additional 3PLs and managed a ~30x loads per day book. However, I realized there’s limited growth in carrier sales and wanted to explore the other side of the business without reverting to broker sales. So, I sought out direct shippers, vendors, and freight forwarders to advance my career. Recently, I secured a logistics analyst position at a large company overseeing the supply chain for a fast food chain. A few days into the role, I feel overwhelmed. The interview process was straightforward, and I was honest about my analytical experience, aware of the learning curve ahead. The main change is the lack of daily hustle to maximize books, which is how I demonstrated my productivity. I'm reaching out to the previous analyst to learn what worked and what didn’t regarding early networking. Beyond that, I'm unsure how to excel in this role. Any advice or insights on transitioning from a fast-paced sales position to an analyst role would be greatly appreciated.",

I'm sharing this not to boast, but to illustrate that I handle large accounts where my competitors are major 3PLs. One of my shippers deals in electronics with shipments valued at $250k. My competitors (TQL, CH, Arrive) consistently secure more freight, which is fine, but their extremely low prices seem unusual. My question is whether large 3PLs sometimes risk shipping high-value cargo using trucks with only $100k cargo insurance, while a $250k insured carrier might transport for an Albanian owner-operator with just $100k insurance. If one shipment encounters an accident or theft and my insurance is inadequate, it could jeopardize my business. I'd appreciate your thoughts on this issue.",

My role involves receiving tenders from clients, building loads in our systems, and posting loads on platforms like DAT to find carriers. I negotiate rates and send rate confirmations, but I don’t track carriers; that’s handled by check callers who monitor GPS and handle inquiries. They report any issues to my boss and me. If clients have questions or need assistance while my boss is unavailable, I address those. I also schedule pickups and deliveries via email or various TMS, and I close loads after verifying the PODs. My boss and I essentially perform the same daily tasks, but I don't seek new clients; those are assigned to us by the accounts manager once agreements are made. Can I list \"broker\" on my resume, or is there more I need to learn to qualify as one?

  "content": "C.H. Robinson announced on September 11 that it has opened a new 400,000-square-foot logistics facility in Laredo, Texas, expanding its presence along the Mexico border to 1.5 million square feet. The facility features 154 dock doors, accommodating up to 700 trailers, making it one of Laredo's largest cross-docking centers. Mike Burkhart, C.H. Robinson’s vice president for Mexico, explained that typically, three trucks are needed to transport a shipment through Laredo: a Mexican carrier delivers the trailer to the border, a transfer carrier crosses it, and then the freight is transferred to a U.S. carrier. He noted that the larger cross-dock allows for immediate unloading and reduces reloading time since forklift drivers avoid unnecessary movement. If 350 loads are picked up in a day, reducing load time by 10 minutes saves nearly 60 hours total. C.H. Robinson manages over 1 million shipments annually at the Mexico-U.S. border.",

Don’t let Dispatchers know you’re a new broker they will obliterate you on rates if they sense weakness. On the carrier side, confidence is key when selling to carriers and it obviously helps Customer side too.",

  "content": "I have a question and need some advice. I run a small business that ships freight daily, spending around $20,000 monthly. When an order is ready, I request quotes from my 3PL partners and direct carriers, choose the best offer, and receive a BOL. Recently, I've considered handling this myself. My main roles are in sales and operations, while my partner manages finances. I often spend time following up on freight quotes and issues. I wonder if I could take an entry-level sales job with a company like XPO or R&L, then become a customer to ship our freight at lower rates. Alternatively, could I register as a broker, cold call carriers to reduce our costs, and possibly gain extra business? Or should I just stick to my current process? Freight is a significant expense, and I want to lower it. I'm also seeking a flexible side gig, ideally one based on commission, given that I already do cold calling for my own business. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",

      "body": "Creating a brand new brokerage would be extremely tough right now. With all the fraud carriers / brokers alike do not want to work with anyone with a brand new MC#. Becoming a freight agent is an interesting take given the fact its your own freight but even that is probably not worth the hassle.\n\nThe best option for you is probably going to be to find more brokers (Wont be hard considering how many of us there are) and try and get a cheaper rate or see what YOU can do to make the loads cheaper. Examples of this are weight, good PU and delivery times, (Is your facility FCFS, are delivery appointments in the morning with quick unloads) etc. Those things can get the rate of your freight down a lot more as well. If your loads are easy to deal with and simple, you will get offered lower rates.",

Time is money, and if you’re wasting time on what a good broker should be doing for you, then you’re doing it wrong or have the wrong partners. When you have the scale to hire a logistics specific employee, then focus on the spend.",

      "body": "Freight will always be a major cost. The profit off your $20k month from a broker would LIKELY be around 15%, $3000. The rep that runs that would get between 15-25% of that. It all depends on who you’re using and if you’re shopping price on every load it’s likely that % could be lower. Also, are you running FTL/LTL/partial? The variables are many and the opportunity for you to out price your current selection with your own service would be negligible and a ton more work",
