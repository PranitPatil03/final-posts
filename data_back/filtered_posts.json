I\u2019ll get my manufacturer to send to them at a single time, they store and ship those items when needed precisely. What are some good choices?  ",

        "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI recently joined a new company as an assistant role in the supply team,\n\nMy company uses an inhouse cloud based system which manages everything, but however I feel like it is very primitive and doesn't have all the features of any modern warehouse/inventory management software . Because of this, our team is under a lot of pressure tackling unnecessary issues on an everyday basis.\n\n The corporate cannot replace the system since its been used by other locations as well. \n\nBut however, I was wondering if I could integrate an API between the inhouse system that we have and a modern warehouse management system, that could talk to each other and reconcile information.\n\nAlso, we already have a lot of equipment like multiple handheld mobile scanners running on android, barcode printers, wearable barcode scanners which was ordered by a previous employee but never used because the equipment cannot be integrated with the inhouse system that we have.\n\nPlease suggest me the best way to tackle this, and I would appreciate if anybody could suggest me a good warehouse management/ inventory tracking software to integrate all of the equipment.\n\n  \nThanks and Regards.\n\n",

You double your support effort, complicate troubleshooting, and have a completely non-standard interface.  You will also find that \"an API' will quickly turn into about 20 API's.  Could you do it?  Sure, it's just time and money.  But you'll never be happy with the results.  And if corporate won't let you replace it, they'll certainly not let you overlay something new on top of it.",

But it\u2019s crazy anyway and that\u2019s sounds more like you need to push for company wide change or in-house development of what you already have.",

Likewise you might connect subsystems on top of your WMS for controlling conveyors, voice picking etc.  If your base system is good enough, you could get someone in to assess and quote a voice system or similar to go on top.  All this tends to cost alot, so .. your scale and the size of the problem itself will determine whether it is worth the effort.  A half assed implementation is often worse than doing nothing.",

I'm not looking for promotion but rather upskill for professional development and earning potential in the long run.\n\n**Factors I'm considering:**\n\n1. **Time**\u00a0\\- Masters would typically require 2yrs whilst cert/training could be 3-6mos.\n2. **Type of Program/Study to take**:\n   * Masters:\n      * Eng'g Management\n      * SCM Finance\n   * Cert/Training:\n      * Six Sigma Green/Black Belt\n      * Data Analytics & Business Intelligence\n      * Demand Planning/Forecasting\n3. **Location**: Hybrid (onsite/virtual)\n4.

        "content": "Hey everyone! At Descartes, we\u2019ve been diving deep into the trends shaping home delivery, and we just wrapped up our **2024 Home Delivery Sustainability Study**. With so much happening in logistics and the global economy, we wanted to explore how consumer preferences around sustainability are influencing the last-mile delivery space.\n\n* **57% of consumers** are interested in sustainable home delivery options.\n* A staggering **99%** are open to doing more to reduce their carbon footprint.\n* **89%** said economic pressures, like inflation, affect whether they can afford to pay extra for eco-friendly delivery.\n* **37%** now weigh **convenience** and **sustainability** equally when choosing delivery options.\n\nOne notable trend is the rise of **green delivery slots**, where multiple orders are bundled into fewer trips to cut emissions and reduce costs. **56%** of respondents are ready to adopt this practice. For last-mile providers, this could be a key innovation to not only help the environment but also manage operational costs more effectively.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take? How is the last-mile space adapting to meet sustainability goals while dealing with cost constraints? Any new tech or processes helping you balance both?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts! \ud83d\ude4c If you\u2019re interested in diving deeper into the full study, you can check it out here:  \n[https://engage.descartes.com/descartes-insights/featured/2024-home-delivery-sustainability-the-environmentally-conscious-consumer-under-pressure](https://engage.descartes.com/descartes-insights/featured/2024-home-delivery-sustainability-the-environmentally-conscious-consumer-under-pressure)",
